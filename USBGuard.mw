}}

Untrusted USB devices can pose a substantial threat in certain situations. Adversaries can sometimes insert USB devices while a victim is away from their computer, or replace legitimate USB devices with lookalikes. A common attack is to plug a device into a victim's system that injects a pre-programmed keystroke sequence upon insertion. This keystroke sequence runs arbitrary code on the device (for instance, by opening a terminal and then typing shell commands into it), and the attacker leverages this to download and install a more useful payload such as a remote access trojan or information stealer. <ref>
https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky
</ref> More sophisticated devices may allow an attacker to remotely send keystrokes to the victim's device.

USBGuard attempts to mitigate a limited subset of USB hardware attacks by rejecting most USB devices that are plugged in after bootup. Devices that have a high likelihood of being used maliciously are rejected, while devices that would plausibly be inserted into the system in most normal user workflows are accepted.

= Version Specific Notice =
USBGuard is installed and enabled by default in Kicksecure 18 and higher.

= Configuration =
The [https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf default USBGuard policy] is saved under <code>/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf</code> and is provided by the [https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc security-misc] package. USBGuard requires this file's permissions to be set so that only the root account can access it.

By default, the following policy is enforced by USBGuard. Most of this behavior is configured by the rules file from security-misc.

* <u>Existing devices allowed:</u> All devices present when USBGuard starts are accepted. USBGuard is configured to automatically start at boot time.
* <u>Boot time devices allowed:</u> Any devices attached before system boot are accepted.
* <u>Newly attached devices rejected by default:</u> All newly inserted devices are rejected by default, unless they are whitelisted.
* <u>Invalid interface descriptors rejected:</u> Devices with malformed or invalid interface descriptors are automatically denied.
* <u>Conditional input device acceptance:</u> New keyboards and mice are allowed if and only if no existing USB keyboard and mouse is attached. (If a USB keyboard is already attached, a second USB keyboard will be rejected, and likewise with USB mice.)
* <u>Mixed-interface input devices rejected:</u> Any device that provides a keyboard or mouse alongside a non-keyboard or non-mouse interface will be rejected. (A "unified" keyboard/mouse device, such as is common with some wireless input bundles, will be accepted, subject to the above restriction on how many input devices can be connected at once.)
* <u>Mass storage rule:</u> All mass storage devices are allowed, so long as they provide '''only''' a mass storage interface. Devices that combine mass storage with some other interface are rejected.

If you wish to whitelist additional devices, you can create additional configuration files, for instance <code>/etc/usbguard/rules.d/50_user.conf</code>. See the [https://usbguard.github.io/documentation/rule-language.html USBGuard rule language documentation] for more information.

| text    = USBGuard will fail to start if any configuration file under <code>/etc/usbguard/rules.d</code> is not owned by root or uses permissions other than <code>0600</code> (read and write for root, no access for anyone else). Always ensure that file ownership and permissions are correct when reconfiguring USBGuard, for instance by running <code>chown root:root /etc/usbguard/rules.d/50_user.conf; chmod 0600 /etc/usbguard/rules.d/50_user.conf</code> after creating a new configuration file.
}}

= Platform Specific Notice =
The configuration directory is <code>/etc/usbguard.d</code>.

* Kicksecure: No special notice.
* Kicksecure for Qubes: [[Qubes#Qubes_Persistence|Qubes Persistence]] is required prerequisite knowledge.

= Limitations =
The above policy is expected to help prevent some common USB-based attacks. However, '''USBGuard is not a replacement for only using trusted USB devices, nor can it reliably defend against attackers with physical access.''' There are a number of attacks that {{project_name_short}}'s USBGuard configuration does not defend against, for instance:

* Keystroke injection, if the injecting device only presents itself as a keyboard and you have no USB keyboard already attached to your system. This attack cannot be prevented without rejecting all keyboard devices.
* Over-voltage attacks intended to cause physical damage to the machine (i.e. "USB killer" attacks <ref>
https://usbkill.com/
</ref>). These attacks cannot be prevented by USBGuard at all, as they do not have to interact with the OS in any way to be successful.
* Exploitation of application or kernel bugs via crafted data on a mass storage device. This attack cannot be prevented without rejecting all USB storage devices.

Users are encouraged to assume determined attackers can bypass USBGuard. It should only be trusted to provide an additional layer of frustration to an attacker.

USBGuard is a device-level gate, not a keystroke-level firewall. Once you have decided "this is a keyboard, and I will allow it," the operating system intentionally trusts it exactly like a real human typing. At that point:

* it can send any keystrokes,
* including weird [[Unicode|Invisible Malicious Unicode]] / control sequences,
* including opening a terminal and pasting a malicious payload.

USBGuard can help before that point (by refusing extra/composite/suspicious HIDs, or "second keyboard" devices). It cannot help after you have allowed a malicious keyboard.

The only protection is "do not allow the wrong keyboard to be accepted in the first place". "Accept a malicious keyboard and hope USBGuard filters bad keystrokes" is impossible.

= Disable USBGuard =
* <u>Optional.</u>
* <u>Discouraged:</u> '''This will reduce security, all USB devices will be accepted by default.'''

Disable USBGuard entirely.

{{IconSet|h1|1}} {{sysmaint_notice}}

{{IconSet|h1|2}} Disable USBGuard.

Run the following commands.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl disable usbguard.service
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl disable usbguard-dbus.service
}}

{{IconSet|h1|3}} Reboot.

{{IconSet|h1|4}} Done.

USBGuard will not run on subsequent reboots unless explicitly re-enabled.

= Enable USBGuard =
To re-enable USBGuard, run:

{{IconSet|h1|1}} {{sysmaint_notice}}

{{IconSet|h1|2}} Enable USBGuard.

Run the following commands.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl enable usbguard.service
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl enable usbguard-dbus.service
}}

{{IconSet|h1|3}} Reboot.

{{IconSet|h1|4}} Done.

USBGuard will run on subsequent reboots.

= Troubleshooting =
If you use less common USB devices (USB microphones, MIDI devices, touchscreens, etc.), USBGuard will most likely block your ability to use them. To work around this:

* Shut down the system, plug in the device, then turn the system back on. USBGuard will implicitly trust devices that exist in the system during startup.
* Create a configuration file in <code>/etc/usbguard/rules.d</code> that whitelists your USB device. This will allow you to freely plug in the device without issues, but may potentially lessen security depending on your threat model.

To create an empty configuration file as a starting point:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo install -m 0600 -o root -g root /dev/null /etc/usbguard/rules.d/50_user.conf
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo usbguard list-devices --blocked
}}

For example:

<u>Note:</u> Replace number <u><code>32</code></u> with the actual number of the device.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo usbguard allow-device --permanent 32
}}
