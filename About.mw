= Development Vision =

== Introduction ==

While many valuable security guides exist, better security and privacy for the masses necessitates software that applies a majority of hardening instructions by default.

This is the reason the Free and Open Source {{project_name_short}} project exist; to offer a system that provides a reasonable security-hardened baseline, with the in-built flexibility to apply additional hardening dependent upon the user's threat model, hardware capabilities, motivation and knowledge. <ref>
It is also accepted that no "perfect configuration" exists that can make a system invulnerable against advanced adversaries. Further, systems that are excessively hardened can become almost unusable except for the most advanced individuals.
</ref> The table below provides a further rationale for this position.

'''Table:''' ''Security Guide Limitations''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| '''Factor'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Initial vulnerability
| When a base system is first installed, various security customizations are not yet applied. All users are vulnerable during this period.
|-
! scope="row"| Recipient insecurity
| Security principles do not exist in a vacuum:
* Even after applying various security hardening steps, correspondence/network partners might have serious, unaddressed vulnerabilities.
* Some security problems cannot be solved by individuals and may rely on factors in the broader ecosystem. For example:
** Advanced adversaries perform continual surveillance of all Internet traffic and attempt to attribute collected meta-data to individuals.
** Following a guide to enhance entropy is insufficient if Tor relays being used are insecure.
** Often personal security can only be improved if the security of others is also improved.
|-
! scope="row"| Reliance on human memory
| Adequate hardening often depends on discovering and remembering to apply all necessary steps from favorite security guides.
|-
! scope="row"| Error risks
| Manually applying security guide steps can lead to mistakes that render the whole procedure ineffective.
|-
! scope="row"| Time requirements
| Security guide steps are often lengthy and cover many different facets of computing.
|-
! scope="row"| Secure guide discovery
| There are countless security/hardening guides available on the Internet. It is impossible to follow them all and serious research is required to find valuable new resources.
|-
! scope="row"| Incompleteness
| Logically there is not one definitive, all-encompassing security guide. This means some users harden the kernel and install CPU microcode updates, while others rely on sandboxing and implement better random number generators, and so on. Most users miss critical elements because they are simply not aware they exist.
|-
! scope="row"| Currency
| Even the best security guides often contain outdated material. This is especially true for technically detailed or lengthy guides that canvass many topics.
|-
! scope="row"| Publication form
| The form of security guides can effect their utility. For example, those published in blogs and which do not allow comments have grave disadvantages compared to systems relying on collaborative version control software (like git) or collaborative websites (such as a wiki). The reason is contributors can easily fix issues or update contents.
|-
! scope="row"| Popularity
| Security guides which have low popularity cannot effect change and improve security practices if most people are unaware they exist.
|}

For these reasons {{project_name_short}} will remain focused on enabling the majority of (reasonable) hardening settings by default, and allowing additional settings to be easily enforced via installable packages.

== {{project_name_short}} Development Goals ==
{{project_name_short}} is a security-hardened Linux Distribution. (<u>Mobile version not planned yet.</u>)

This section details potential future security enhancements for {{project_name_short}}.

(The wiki source for the following text can be found [[Template:Kicksecure_Android|in Template:Kicksecure_Android]].)
{{kicksecure_Android}}

{{project_name_short}} will not implement these kinds of user freedom restrictions since it is not required nor desirable. The capability to replace the operating system or gain administrator access will remain fully supported. Many popular device operating systems utilize security technologies which restrict user freedoms. In contrast, {{project_name_short}} aims to utilize the same security concepts for the goal of empowering the user and increasing protection from malware.

It is theoretically possible to provide some of the same iPhone / Android security concepts on a Linux computer too. Steps have already been made to apply mobile device security concepts to Linux distributions such as [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc] and [https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d apparmor.d]. Security technologies like hardened kernels or verified boot used by popular mobile operating systems could also be ported to Linux distributions. Community contributions are gladly welcomed!

= Design =

== Usability by Default ==

While developed with security-focused design goals, {{project_name_short}} remains highly flexible. The layered approach to security allows applications to retain usability. {{project_name_short}} can be used for everyday "general-purpose computing" or for more risky activities that require a highly advanced security-centric platform. Since {{project_name_short}} is [[Reasons for Freedom Software|Freedom Software]] users may install any application of their choosing -- no restrictions are placed on how {{project_name_short}} can be used, customized or modified.

{{project_name_short}} aims to maximize usability by default so it can be utilized as an everyday, multipurpose operating system by users of all skill levels.

! scope="row"| Debian Usability Fixes 
|
* Functional default APT sources configuration. <ref>
Debian comes with a broken <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file by default.

* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes with a broken <code>deb cd-rom:</code> line.
* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes with <code>http</code> instead of <code>https</code> by default.
* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> has only the <code>debian-security</code> repository enabled by default but not the <code>debian</code> repository. As a result, no packages are installable until the user figures out how to add that line to APT sources.

When using Debian Installer (not Calamares), installing while not using a network mirror, Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes empty except fora broken <code>deb cd-rom:</code> line.
</ref>
* <code>sudo</code> pre-configured by default. <ref>
On Debian, the user must run after a new installation <code>su</code> followed by <code>/usr/bin/adduser user sudo</code> and reboot (or re-login) to be able to user <code>sudo</code>.
</ref>
* <code>bash-completion</code> installed by default so for example by typing <code>sudo apt install libreo</code> followed by the TAB key a word completion to <code>libreoffice</code> will be suggested.
* <code>zsh</code> installed as default shell that supports TAB word completion, colorful output, etc.

* Package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist shared folder help] simplifies shared folder set up for virtual machines. <ref>
It currently only assists with using shared folders in VirtualBox. Other virtualizers -- such as KVM shared folder setup -- might be possible in the future.
</ref>
* Package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/usability-misc usabilty-misc] is installed by default, increasing flexibility and providing numerous, miscellaneous usability features. <ref>Such as creating default folders, allowing commands to be run without a password, simplifying the running of OpenVPN as an unpriveleged user, and much more.</ref>

== Based on Debian ==

{{Based_on_Debian}}

== Based on Freedom Software ==

Many people wonder why developers would spend countless hours of their own time to build an operating system and then give it away. {{project_name_short}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free] / [[Reasons for Freedom Software|Freedom Software]] components and give back nothing to the community. We stand on the shoulders of giants. {{project_name_short}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested time in writing code and kept it accessible for the public's benefit. Of course, a lot of us just find it great fun.

== User Population / Promotion ==

* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{project_name_short}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
