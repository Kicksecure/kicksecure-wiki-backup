__TOC__

= Hardening by Default =

{{project_name_short}} is a hardened operating system designed to be resistant to viruses and various attacks. It is based on Debian in accordance with an advanced multi-layer defense model, thereby providing in-depth security. {{project_name_short}} provides protection from many types of malware in its default configuration with no customization required.

|-

! <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>: multiple boot modes for better security
| Kicksecure increases safety by enforcing use of separate accounts for daily use and administrative tasks. This is called [[sysmaint|user-sysmaint-split]]. It prevents daily used, high-risk software with large attack surface that can be hacked such as a web [[browser]] from gaining full administrative ("[[root]]") access. Therefore, otherwise trivial deployment of rootkits and [[Backdoor#Firmware_Trojan|firmware trojan]]s (a type of [[malware]] / [[Backdoor#Hardware_Backdoor|hardware backdoor]]) is prevented.
|-

! scope="row"| Default Package Selection
| {{anchor|Default_security_software}} No unnecessary software is installed by default such as exim, samba, cups that otherwise gets installed by some flavors of Debian. <ref>
Debian bookworm Xfce live ISO installed exim, samba, cups by default.

{{Anchor|torified_updates}}
Secure and privacy-protected operating system (<code>apt</code>) upgrades
[[File:Tor-logo.png|thumb|100px|alt=Tor logo]]
| [[File:Malware-updates-promo.jpg|thumb|alt=Malware updates promo]]
This helps protect against targeted, malicious software upgrades.

By default, when using APT (Advanced Package Tool) to upgrade the system or install new software, {{project_name_short}} uses torified operating system upgrades. This means all default APT package manager source files are set to only update over the Tor anonymity network. This makes sure that update servers cannot know who the user is or their IP address. As a result, this mitigates targeted malicious software attacks. This protection is not only much stronger than what iPhones or Android devices offer, but it's also better than what most Linux distributions provide.

* <u>Worst</u>: Most iPhone / Android devices <ref name=most-mobile /> connect to official app stores, and these app stores know the user's identity and IP address, creating a large risk for targeted attacks. <ref name=targeted-updates />
* <u>Better</u>: Some Linux distributions like Debian do not link the user's identity to update servers, but they still update over the clearnet (regular internet) using the user's real IP address by default.
* <u>Best</u>: {{Kicksecure}} ensures all system updates are done over the Tor network by default. This way, update servers cannot know the user's identity or IP address. <ref>
* {{Github_link|repo=anon-apt-sources-list|path=/blob/master/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list}}</ref>

This only applies to system updates. This does not mean that all of your internet traffic is automatically torified (protected by Tor). See also: [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]]

| {{anchor|Secure_Package_Sources_Configuration}} HTTPS (TLS) is enabled by default in APT. <ref>

| [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tirdad tirdad (TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization)] prevents TCP ISN-based CPU Information Leaks; see footnote. <ref><blockquote>The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug. It is leaked in any outgoing traffic. This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about a system's CPU activity is leaked. It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of location-hidden services.</blockquote></ref>

= Development Vision =

== Introduction ==

While many valuable security guides exist, better security and privacy for the masses necessitates software that applies a majority of hardening instructions by default.

This is the reason the Free and Open Source {{project_name_short}} project exist; to offer a system that provides a reasonable security-hardened baseline, with the in-built flexibility to apply additional hardening dependent upon the user's threat model, hardware capabilities, motivation and knowledge. <ref>
It is also accepted that no "perfect configuration" exists that can make a system invulnerable against advanced adversaries. Further, systems that are excessively hardened can become almost unusable except for the most advanced individuals.
</ref> The table below provides a further rationale for this position.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ ''Security Guide Limitations''
|-
! scope="col"| '''Factor'''
! scope="col"| '''Description'''
|-
! scope="row"| Initial vulnerability
| When a base system is first installed, various security customizations are not yet applied. All users are vulnerable during this period.
|-
! scope="row"| Recipient insecurity
| Security principles do not exist in a vacuum:
* Even after applying various security hardening steps, correspondence/network partners might have serious, unaddressed vulnerabilities.
* Some security problems cannot be solved by individuals and may rely on factors in the broader ecosystem. For example:
** Advanced adversaries perform continual surveillance of all Internet traffic and attempt to attribute collected meta-data to individuals.
** Following a guide to enhance entropy is insufficient if Tor relays being used are insecure.
** Often personal security can only be improved if the security of others is also improved.
|-
! scope="row"| Reliance on human memory
| Adequate hardening often depends on discovering and remembering to apply all necessary steps from favorite security guides.
|-
! scope="row"| Error risks
| Manually applying security guide steps can lead to mistakes that render the whole procedure ineffective.
|-
! scope="row"| Time requirements
| Security guide steps are often lengthy and cover many different facets of computing.
|-
! scope="row"| Secure guide discovery
| There are countless security/hardening guides available on the Internet. It is impossible to follow them all and serious research is required to find valuable new resources.
|-
! scope="row"| Incompleteness
| Logically there is not one definitive, all-encompassing security guide. This means some users harden the kernel and install CPU microcode updates, while others rely on sandboxing and implement better random number generators, and so on. Most users miss critical elements because they are simply not aware they exist.
|-
! scope="row"| Currency
| Even the best security guides often contain outdated material. This is especially true for technically detailed or lengthy guides that canvass many topics.
|-
! scope="row"| Publication form
| The form of security guides can effect their utility. For example, those published in blogs and which do not allow comments have grave disadvantages compared to systems relying on collaborative version control software (like git) or collaborative websites (such as a wiki). The reason is contributors can easily fix issues or update contents.
|-
! scope="row"| Popularity
| Security guides which have low popularity cannot effect change and improve security practices if most people are unaware they exist.
|}

For these reasons {{project_name_short}} will remain focused on enabling the majority of (reasonable) hardening settings by default, and allowing additional settings to be easily enforced via installable packages. For further information on this topic, see: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/the-problem-with-security-guides-and-how-we-can-fix-it/8563 The Problem with Security Guides and How We Can Fix It].

== Implementation of the Securing Debian Manual ==
The {{project_name_short}} project has been studying the [https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ Securing Debian Manual], which is a security hardening guide for Debian. {{project_name_short}} is applying the operating system hardening, suggested in the manual, by default as much as reasonably possible.

Unfortunately, the Securing Debian Manual has not been updated in a while <ref>
Securing Debian Manual:

still referring to:

* <code>sysvinit</code> and not mentioning <code>systemd</code>
* <code>initrd</code> and not mentioning <code>dracut</code>
</ref> and is therefore already somewhat dated. For this reason {{project_name_short}} also documents the up-to-date security hardening knowledge we gather in our wiki as a public service.

For attribution, the wiki [[Template:Sdebian]] is added to all wiki pages where the Securing Debian Manual has been considered. A list of these pages can be found on [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Sdebian]]. Example for the disclaimer below:

== Planned Features ==

The {{project_name_short}} development roadmap includes various security improvements:

* Many features are already available for testing, see [[Test]] wiki page.
* Encrypted and/or authenticated system-wide DNS (domain name resolution) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 use DNSCrypt by default]

DNS spoofing results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).
</ref> See also [[DNS Security]].
* Validating DNS.
* [[apparmor.d]]

== {{project_name_short}} Development Goals ==
{{project_name_short}} is a security-hardened Linux Distribution. (<u>Mobile version not planned yet.</u>)

This section details potential future security enhancements for {{project_name_short}}.

(The wiki source for the following text can be found [[Template:Kicksecure_Android|in Template:Kicksecure_Android]].)
{{kicksecure_Android}}

{{project_name_short}} will not implement these kinds of user freedom restrictions since it is not required nor desirable. The capability to replace the operating system or gain administrator access will remain fully supported. Many popular device operating systems utilize security technologies which restrict user freedoms. In contrast, {{project_name_short}} aims to utilize the same security concepts for the goal of empowering the user and increasing protection from malware.

It is theoretically possible to provide some of the same iPhone / Android security concepts on a Linux computer too. Steps have already been made to apply mobile device security concepts to Linux distributions such as [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc] and [https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d apparmor.d]. Security technologies like hardened kernels or verified boot used by popular mobile operating systems could also be ported to Linux distributions. Community contributions are gladly welcomed!

= Design =

== Usability by Default ==

While developed with security-focused design goals, {{project_name_short}} remains highly flexible. The layered approach to security allows applications to retain usability. {{project_name_short}} can be used for everyday "general-purpose computing" or for more risky activities that require a highly advanced security-centric platform. Since {{project_name_short}} is [[Reasons for Freedom Software|Freedom Software]] users may install any application of their choosing -- no restrictions are placed on how {{project_name_short}} can be used, customized or modified.

{{project_name_short}} aims to maximize usability by default so it can be utilized as an everyday, multipurpose operating system by users of all skill levels.

! scope="row"| Debian Usability Fixes
|
* Better download and instalation instructions.
* Better usability installer. Uses Calamares by default. <ref>
Debian default download link uses D-I.

Debian Live uses Calamares.
</ref>
* Functional default APT sources configuration. <ref>
Debian comes with a broken <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file by default.

* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes with a broken <code>deb cd-rom:</code> line.
* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes with <code>http</code> instead of <code>https</code> by default.
* Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> has only the <code>debian-security</code> repository enabled by default but not the <code>debian</code> repository. As a result, no packages are installable until the user figures out how to add that line to APT sources.

When using Debian Installer (D-I) (not Calamares), installing while not using a network mirror, Debian default <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> comes empty except for a broken <code>deb cd-rom:</code> line.
</ref>
* <code>sudo</code> pre-configured by default. <ref>
On Debian, when installing using D-I (Debian Installer), when setting a root password during installation, the user must run after a new installation <code>su</code> followed by <code>/usr/bin/adduser user sudo</code> and reboot (or re-login) to be able to user <code>sudo</code>.
</ref>
* <code>bash-completion</code> installed by default so for example by typing <code>sudo apt install libreo</code> followed by the TAB key a word completion to <code>libreoffice</code> will be suggested.
* <code>zsh</code> installed as default shell that supports TAB word completion, colorful output, etc.

== Based on Debian ==

{{Based_on_Debian}}

== Based on Freedom Software ==

Many people wonder why developers would spend countless hours of their own time to build an operating system and then give it away. {{project_name_short}} developers believe it is immoral to benefit from those [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free] / [[Reasons for Freedom Software|Freedom Software]] components and give back nothing to the community. We stand on the shoulders of giants. {{project_name_short}} and many other Libre software projects are only made possible because people invested time in writing code and kept it accessible for the public's benefit. Of course, a lot of us just find it great fun.

== User Population / Promotion ==

* Apply as many security settings by default without breaking usability too much.
* {{project_name_short}} is already the base for [[Whonix]] - Anonymous Operating System.
