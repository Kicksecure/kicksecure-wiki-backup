{{IconSet|h1|1}} Common sense is required when choosing the right version number.

{{IconSet|h1|2}} This project publishes git tags using the <code>-developers-only</code> suffix. This suffix is intentionally used to make clear that the tag refers to a developer-focused release line, and that users should verify suitability before using it.

{{IconSet|h1|3}} A separate <code>-stable</code> or <code>-testers-only</code> tag is not maintained. This reduces ongoing maintenance work and avoids requiring additional tagging steps for every release.

{{IconSet|h1|4}} Using a <code>-developers-only</code> tag can still be appropriate, as long as you select the correct version number and confirm that it matches the latest stable release announcement.

{{IconSet|h1|5}} Follow the [[Stay Tuned|{{project_name_short}} News Blog]] and the forums announcements, as they might contain important version selection information.

{{IconSet|h1|1}} Go to [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/news/ {{project_name_short}} forums news category] and look for the latest stable version number.

{{IconSet|h1|2}} Use that version number when choosing the git tag to build, even though the available tag uses the <code>-developers-only</code> suffix.

{{IconSet|h1|3}} Compare this with the version number mentioned in the wiki documentation, and prefer the stable release announcement if there is any mismatch.

{{IconSet|h1|4}} For example, if <code>{{VersionNew}}</code> has been announced as the latest stable release and a git tag <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> is available, then <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> can be used.
