= Distribution Morphing =
What is distro morphing? See [[Distribution Morphing]].

<u>In <code>dom0</code>.</u>

'''1.''' Install <code>debian-{{stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> as per [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/debian/ Qubes Debian Template documentation] which is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

'''2.''' Clone Template <code>debian-{{stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> into template <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code>.

'''3.''' Start the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template.

----

<u>Inside the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template.</u>

'''1.''' Follow the instructions [[Debian|Install {{project_name_short}} inside Debian]], choose meta package <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-qubes-cli</code> or <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-qubes-gui</code>.

'''2.''' Shutdown the Template.

'''3.''' Done.

Distribution morphing of Debian into {{project_name_short}} is complete.

'''4.''' Change Template.

Optional: The user may change the Template for any App Qube from Debian to {{project_name_short}} as per the usual Qubes way.

'''5.''' Create new app Qubes.

Optional: The user may create new App Qubes based on the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template as per the usual Qubes way.

= Template =
There is no ready-made template yet.

Future: This wiki page will be updated once available.

Information for developers:

* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/qubes-template-kicksecure qubes-template-kicksecure]
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9573 build Kicksecure Qubes Template #9573]
* [[Dev/Qubes]]
* Please contribute to {{project_name_short}} and Qubes OS by creating and maintaining a <code>kicksecure-{{VersionShort}}</code> Qubes Template.

= Support Status =
How stable is this? Should be very stable. This is because Qubes-Whonix is based on Kicksecure.

The lead developer of Kicksecure is also a user of Qubes and using Kicksecure in Qubes.

= Service VMs =
{{project_name_short}} in Qubes service VMs such as <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code>, <code>sys-usb</code> are functional. This is classified as [[unsupported]] to avoid complex support requests for issues not caused by {{project_name_short}} being directed at {{project_name_short}} support. <ref>

If using in-VM kernel:

== ClockVM ==

A ClockVM based on the Kicksecure Template is functional out of the box.

The only requirement is that the ClockVM uses Kicksecure as its Template. For example, if using Qubes' default settings, where ClockVM is set to <code>sys-net</code> by default and <code>sys-net</code> has been configured by the user to use <code>qubes-template-kicksecure</code>, then ClockVM will be functional out of the box and use [[sdwdate]] for clock synchronization. See also [[Sdwdate#Qubes_Specific|sdwdate chapter, Qubes Specific]].

'''3.''' Optional: Change ClockVM to a different App Qube.

'''4.''' Ensure that the ClockVM has its Template set to Kicksecure.

'''5.''' Done.

The process of using Kicksecure as ClockVM has been completed.

= ISO =
Using the Kicksecure [[ISO]] is not the recommended way to install {{project_name_long}} on Qubes. Instead, until a [[Qubes#Template|Template]] is available, [[Qubes#Distribution_Morphing|Distribution Morphing]] is the recommended installation method.

If the user wishes to use the ISO for any reason (such as testing, development, comparison, or curiosity), the following steps apply.

Note: You need to download the Kicksecure ISO into a separate AppVM/Qube that will be used to install Kicksecure from (in the example below, the ISO has been downloaded in "debian-personal").

'''1.''' Create a new qube, following the instructions in the image.

[[File:kickiso.png|600px]]

'''2.''' Remove "Install system from device" because we want to modify the VM before installing Kicksecure on it, then press "OK" to create the Kicksecure qube/VM.

[[File:kickiso2.png|600px]]

'''3.''' Enter Kicksecure qube settings.

[[File:kickiso3.png|600px]]

'''4.''' Preferably, change system storage to 20 GB, then press "Advanced".

[[File:kickiso4.png|600px]]

'''5.''' Disable "Include in memory balancing", then increase "Initial memory" to preferably 4 GB. Press "Apply" to adjust the edited settings, then press "Boot qube from CD-ROM" to choose the Kicksecure ISO.

[[File:kickiso5.png|600px]]

'''6.''' Choose the qube where you have downloaded the Kicksecure ISO, then press "..." to browse for the ISO path.

[[File:kickiso6.png|600px]]

'''7.''' Choose Kicksecure ISO.

[[File:kickiso7.png|600px]]

'''8.''' Make sure everything is correctly chosen, then press "OK".

[[File:kickiso8.png|600px]]

'''9.''' Kicksecure is booted and ready to be installed. Kicksecure supports offline installation, so there's no need for network configuration before installation.

[[File:kickiso9.png|600px]]

'''10.''' Done

== Networking ==

If you want to use the internet before or after installation, you need to go through the following steps:

'''1.''' Right-click on the Network Manager taskbar icon, then choose "Edit connections..."

[[File:kickiso10.png|600px]]

'''2.''' Choose "Wired connection 1", then press the settings (gear) icon.

[[File:kickiso11.png|600px]]

'''3.''' Choose "IPv4 settings", then under "Method", select "Manual", and press "Add".

[[File:kickiso12.png|600px]]

'''4.''' Fill in the blanks with the "Net qube" info, except for the subnet mask, which should be set as 255.255.255.0 instead of 255 at the end <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4189</ref>. If the network still doesn't work, try changing the gateway to 10.137.0.1 <ref>https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7412</ref>.

[[File:kickiso13.png|600px]]

'''5.''' After filling in the blanks, press "Save." The Network Manager gear should update itself with the newly added information.

[[File:kickiso14.png|600px]]

'''6.''' Done

== ISO Troubleshooting ==
If the user sees the following:

Then increase RAM according to instructions in chapter [[#ISO]].

= Qubes Persistence =
Qubes (non-)persistence is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

{{Qubes_persistence}}

= Qubes Template Modifications =
If a Qubes template has been modified, to make changes in App Qubes based on that Template take effect, it is required to shut down the Template and restart the App Qubes based on that Template. This is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

To apply changes made to a Template:

'''1.''' Make the required modification to the Template.

'''2.''' Shut down the Template.

'''3.''' Shut down the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''4.''' Start the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''5.''' Done.

These steps ensure that all changes made to the Template are properly propagated to the App Qubes.
