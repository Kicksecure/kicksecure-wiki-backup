|content=
Using the Kicksecure [[ISO]] is <u>not</u> the recommended way to install {{project_name_long}} on Qubes.

If the user wishes to use the ISO for any reason (such as testing, development, comparison, or curiosity), the following steps apply (More details can be found in [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/standalones-and-hvms/ Qubes documentation].

<u>Note:</u> You need to perform downloading the Kicksecure ISO inside a separate App Qube that will be used to install Kicksecure from (in the example below, the ISO has been downloaded in "debian-personal").

'''1.''' Create a new App Qube, following the instructions in the image.

[[File:kickiso.png|600px]]

'''2.''' Remove "Install system from device" because we want to modify the VM before installing Kicksecure on it, then press "OK" to create the Kicksecure App Qube.

[[File:kickiso2.png|600px]]

'''3.''' Enter the Kicksecure Qube settings.

[[File:kickiso3.png|600px]]

'''4.''' Preferably, change system storage to 20 GB, then press "Advanced".

[[File:kickiso4.png|600px]]

'''5.''' Disable "Include in memory balancing", then increase "Initial memory" to preferably 4 GB. Press "Apply" to adjust the edited settings, then press "Boot qube from CD-ROM" to choose the Kicksecure ISO.

[[File:kickiso5.png|600px]]

'''6.''' Choose the App Qube where you have downloaded the Kicksecure ISO, then press "..." to browse for the ISO path.

[[File:kickiso6.png|600px]]

'''7.''' Choose the Kicksecure ISO.

[[File:kickiso7.png|600px]]

'''8.''' Make sure everything is correctly chosen, then press "OK".

[[File:kickiso8.png|600px]]

'''9.''' Kicksecure is booted and ready to be installed. Kicksecure supports offline installation, so there is no need for network configuration before installation.

[[File:kickiso9.png|600px]]

'''10.''' Done

=== HVM - Networking ===

If you want to use the internet before or after installation, you need to go through the following steps:

'''1.''' Right-click on the Network Manager taskbar icon, then choose "Edit connections..."

[[File:kickiso10.png|600px]]

'''2.''' Choose "Wired connection 1", then press the settings (gear) icon.

[[File:kickiso11.png|600px]]

'''3.''' Choose "IPv4 settings", then under "Method", select "Manual", and press "Add".

[[File:kickiso12.png|600px]]

'''4.''' Fill in the blanks with the <code>Net qube</code> info, except for the subnet mask, which should be set as <code>255.255.255.0</code> instead of <code>255</code> at the end <ref> https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4189#issuecomment-515803005 </ref>. If the network still does not work, try changing the gateway to <code>10.137.0.1</code> <ref>
https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7412 </ref>.

[[File:kickiso13.png|600px]]

'''5.''' After filling in the blanks, press "Save." The Network Manager gear should update itself with the newly added information.

[[File:kickiso14.png|600px]]

'''6.''' Done

=== HVM - Troubleshooting ===
==== Low RAM, CLI interface ====

If the user will see:

'''Figure:''' ''virtual console login screen''

[[File:virtual_console.png|600px]]

Then increase RAM according to the instructions in chapter [[#ISO]] to have the graphical entry.

==== Cloned HVM ====
Cloned HVM will not change its internal IP address automatically.

If the user wants to clone their HVM, they must change the internal IP address to match the newly created cloned HVM IP address. <ref>

= Support Status =
How stable is this? It should be very stable. This is because Qubes-Whonix is based on Kicksecure.

The lead developer of Kicksecure is also a user of Qubes and uses Kicksecure in Qubes.

= Service VMs =
{{project_name_short}} in Qubes service VMs such as <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code>, and <code>sys-usb</code> are functional. This is classified as [[unsupported]] to avoid complex support requests for issues not caused by {{project_name_short}} being directed at {{project_name_short}} support. <ref>
https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-for-sys-qubes-and-sys-vpn/442
</ref>

If using in-VM kernel:

{{quotation
|quote=it's problematic for VMs with PCI devices (especially when using Debian kernel, due to old wifi drivers, but there are also other factors like significantly slower boot time in HVM mode).
|context=https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9570#issuecomment-2468812870
}}

== ClockVM ==
A ClockVM based on the Kicksecure Template is functional out of the box.

The only requirement is that the ClockVM uses Kicksecure as its Template. For example, if using Qubes' default settings, where ClockVM is set to <code>sys-net</code> by default and <code>sys-net</code> has been configured by the user to use the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template, then ClockVM will be functional out of the box and use [[sdwdate]] for clock synchronization. See also [[Sdwdate#Qubes_Specific|sdwdate chapter, Qubes Specific]].

'''2.''' Check the ClockVM setting.

{{CodeSelect|code=

Sample setting:

<pre>
sys-net
</pre>

'''3.''' Optional: Change ClockVM to a different App Qube.

'''4.''' Ensure that the ClockVM has its Template set to <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code>.

'''5.''' Done.

The process of using Kicksecure as ClockVM has been completed.

= Qubes Persistence =
Qubes (non-)persistence is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

{{Qubes_persistence}}

= Qubes Template Modifications =
If a Qubes Template has been modified, to make changes in App Qubes based on that Template take effect, it is required to shut down the Template and restart the App Qubes based on that Template. This is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

To apply changes made to a Template:

'''1.''' Make the required modification to the Template.

'''2.''' Shut down the Template.

'''3.''' Shut down the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''4.''' Start the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''5.''' Done.

These steps ensure that all changes made to the Template are properly propagated to the App Qubes.

= Known Issues =

* Qubes has potential local privilege escalation issue: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9717 harden insecure permissions inside <code>/dev/xen</code> folder / research security impact of the Qubes <code>/dev/xen</code> folder permissions #9717] -- This issue is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] and is entirely unrelated to {{project_name_short}}. It equally applies to App Qubes that are not using <code>qubes-core-agent-passwordless-root</code> such as Qubes Debian minimal Template.

= Developer Information =
Information for developers:

* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/qubes-template-kicksecure <code>qubes-template-kicksecure</code>] source code
* Qubes GitHub feature request: [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9573 build Kicksecure Qubes Template #9573]
