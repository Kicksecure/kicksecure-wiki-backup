= Distribution Morphing =
<u>In <code>dom0</code>.</u>

'''1.''' Install <code>debian-{{stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> as per [https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/debian/ Qubes Debian Template documentation] which is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

'''2.''' Clone Template <code>debian-{{stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> into template <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code>.

'''3.''' Start the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template.

----

<u>Inside the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template.</u>

'''1.''' Follow the instructions [[Debian|Install {{project_name_short}} inside Debian]], choose meta package <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-qubes-cli</code> or <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}-qubes-gui</code>.

'''2.''' Shutdown the Template.

'''3.''' Done.

Distribution morphing of Debian into {{project_name_short}} is complete.

'''4.''' Change Template.

Optional: The user may change the Template for any App Qube from Debian to {{project_name_short}} as per the usual Qubes way.

'''5.''' Create new app Qubes.

Optional: The user may create new App Qubes based on the <code>{{project_name_workstation_template}}</code> Template as per the usual Qubes way.

= Template =
There is no ready-made template yet.

Future: This wiki page will be updated once available.

It shouldn't be hard to fork [https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-template-whonix qubes-template-whonix] into <code>kicksecure-qubes-template</code>. Please contribute to {{project_name_short}} and Qubes OS by creating and maintaining a <code>kicksecure-{{VersionShort}}</code> Qubes Template.

= Support Status =
How stable is this? Should be very stable. This is because Qubes-Whonix is based on Kicksecure.

The lead developer of Kicksecure is also a user of Qubes and using Kicksecure in Qubes.

= Service VMs =
{{project_name_short}} in Qubes service VMs such as <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code>, <code>sys-usb</code> are functional. This is classified as [[unsupported]] to avoid complex support requests for issues not caused by {{project_name_short}} being directed at {{project_name_short}} support. <ref>
https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-for-sys-qubes-and-sys-vpn/442
</ref>

= ISO =
Using the Kicksecure [[ISO]] is not the recommended way to install {{project_name_long}} on Qubes. Instead, until a [[Qubes#Template|Template]]  will be available, [[Qubes#Distribution_Morphing|Distribution Morphing]] is the recommended installation method.

Should the user wish to use the ISO anyhow (for example for purposes of testing, development, comparison, curiosity), the following notes are made.

'''1.''' Increase initial RAM.

4 GB RAM are recommended. Feel free to experiment with less. When using the Qubes default setting, [[rads]] will not boot a graphical user interface.

Qubes VM Manager &rarr; click on the VM &rarr; right click &rarr; Settings &rarr; initial memory: 4000 MB (or other choice).

'''2.''' Networking.

== ISO Troubleshooting ==
If the user sees the following:

'''Figure:''' ''virtual console login screen''

}}

Then increase RAM according to instructions in chapter [[#ISO]].

= Qubes Persistence =
Qubes (non-)persistence is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

{{Qubes_persistence}}

= Qubes Template Modifications =
If a Qubes template has been modified, to make changes in App Qubes based on that Template take effect, it is required to shut down the Template and restart the App Qubes based on that Template. This is a Qubes default and [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

To apply changes made to a Template:

'''1.''' Make the required modification to the Template.

'''2.''' Shut down the Template.

'''3.''' Shut down the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''4.''' Start the App Qube based on the modified Template.

'''5.''' Done.

These steps ensure that all changes made to the Template are properly propagated to the App Qubes.
