=== Polish qubes-gui-runuser.c env var code, research slab_debug security concerns ===
Date: 2025-10-07

Fixed several bugs in the draft implementation of the environment variable import code from yesterday, and got the new implementation to work in a Debian 13 Xfce template. Also did substantial research into security concerns around the <code>slab_debug</code> kernel parameter, and how to mitigate them best. Requested that the Debian kernel team backport a new pointer hashing boot parameter from kernel 6.17 into the Trixie stable kernel.

=== Create draft implementation for importing env vars from systemd in qubes-gui-runuser.c ===
Date: 2025-10-06

The preliminary fix for the environment variable bug in Qubes was insufficient because it meant now environment variables from systemd were being clobbered with those from /etc/profile.d. The intended behavior was that environment variables from systemd should be imported, then augmented by /etc/profile.d. Marek suggested implementing code to do this in qubes-gui-runuser.c, using D-Bus to communicate with systemd to get the environment variables and export them into the session. I created an initial rough draft of this implementation and posted it for initial review.

=== Attempt to debug kloak-related systemd unit ordering cycle ===
Date: 2025-10-06

Installed an older version of kloak into a Debian 13 GNOME VM. Could not reproduce issue, waiting on more info.

=== Remove sanitizers from compiled code ===
Date: 2025-10-06

We were enabling sanitizers such as AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer as a hardening measure, but it turns out this actually made programs less secure and that these sanitizers are not intended for production code. Disabled C sanitizers on all of our C code.

=== Investigate Qubes input event buffering flicker bug with Qt ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Previously I discovered that Qt apps had some odd flickering behavior with some menus when input event buffering was enabled. Attempted to find the root cause, the cause hasn't been identified for certain but a possible problem has been identified. Discussed it with Marek briefly.

=== Test socat's suitability for use as a DNS proxy in sys-net ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Got socat working so that IPv6 DNS on an IPv6 network worked. Discussed the suitability of this solution with Marek.

=== Debug, create preliminary fix for Qubes-Whonix file manager launch bug ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Marek discovered that the default file manager in Whonix 18 was Catfish, when it should be PCManFM-Qt. After much study it was discovered this was the result of an outdated xdg override combined with an environment variable loading issue in Qubes OS itself. Filed a bug report for the environment variable load issue, discussed possible ways of fixing it with Marek, and submitted a PR. A different approach than the one provided in the PR will need to be used in the long run.

=== Test Qubes OS IPv6 DNS PRs ===
Date: 2025-10-04

Closely read through, polished, and tested the IPv6 DNS PRs from 3nprob. Unfortunately the approach being used by them is insufficient on its own due to some routers exposing a DNS server on a link-local IPv6 address, which cannot be properly targetted by a DNAT rule. Some sort of manual forwarding using a tool such as socat will likely be required.
