=== Investigate Qubes input event buffering flicker bug with Qt ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Previously I discovered that Qt apps had some odd flickering behavior with some menus when input event buffering was enabled. Attempted to find the root cause, the cause hasn't been identified for certain but a possible problem has been identified. Discussed it with Marek briefly.

=== Test socat's suitability for use as a DNS proxy in sys-net ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Got socat working so that IPv6 DNS on an IPv6 network worked. Discussed the suitability of this solution with Marek.

=== Debug, create preliminary fix for Qubes-Whonix file manager launch bug ===
Date: 2025-10-05

Marek discovered that the default file manager in Whonix 18 was Catfish, when it should be PCManFM-Qt. After much study it was discovered this was the result of an outdated xdg override combined with an environment variable loading issue in Qubes OS itself. Filed a bug report for the environment variable load issue, discussed possible ways of fixing it with Marek, and submitted a PR. A different approach than the one provided in the PR will need to be used in the long run.

=== Test Qubes OS IPv6 DNS PRs ===
Date: 2025-10-04

Closely read through, polished, and tested the IPv6 DNS PRs from 3nprob. Unfortunately the approach being used by them is insufficient on its own due to some routers exposing a DNS server on a link-local IPv6 address, which cannot be properly targetted by a DNAT rule. Some sort of manual forwarding using a tool such as socat will likely be required.
