{{intro|
A point release is not a separate, new version of {{project_name_long}}. Instead, it is a re-release of {{project_name_long}} which is inclusive of all updates up to a certain point.
}}
Installing any version of {{project_name_short}} {{VersionShort}} and fully updating it leads to a system which is ([[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Update_vs_Image_Re-Installation|mostly]]) identical to installing a {{project_name_short}} point release.

If the {{project_name_short}} installation is [[Update|updated]], no further action is required.

Regardless of the current installed version of {{project_name_short}}, if users wish to install (or reinstall) {{project_name_short}} for any reason, then the point release is a convenient and more secure method, since it bundles all {{project_name_short}} updates that are available at that specific time.

To determine whether an update or image re-installation is better, see: [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Update_vs_Image_Re-Installation|Update vs Image Re-Installation]].
