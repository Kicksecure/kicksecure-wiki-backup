Hardware backdoors, vulnerabilities versus malicious backdoors, real-world examples like the XZ Utils and Copay wallet backdoors, and understand the threats posed by firmware and hardware trojans.

= Vulnerability versus Malicious Backdoor =
The word "backdoor" is not well defined. A vulnerability (or "bugdoor") can serve as a backdoor. Hence, many people use the terms vulnerability and backdoor as synonyms. This, however, confuses the boundaries between vulnerability and "malicious backdoors," for which a stronger word than just "backdoor" must now be used.

== Vulnerability Example ==

Bad (buffer overflow vulnerability):

<pre>
char buf[10]; fgets(buf, sizeof(buf) - 1, stdin);
</pre>

Good example pseudo code (not vulnerable to buffer overflow):

<pre>
char buf[10]; fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
</pre>

Just a small code difference. Can be introduced by mistake, which happens a lot or intentionally.

== Malicious Backdoor ==
=== Malicious Backdoor - Definition ===
Malicious backdoor pseudocode example:

<pre>
# If the wallet balance is greater than 100, steal it.
if wallet_balance >= 100
  send_to_hacker("1HackerBTCAddressHere", wallet_balance)
end
# Otherwise, do nothing.
</pre>

It's expressive. It's targeted. It's intentional. Direct evidence.

=== Malicious Backdoor - Examples ===
==== Bitpay Wallet Malicious Backdoor ====
Bitpay Wallet at the time was called Copay Bitcoin Wallet. It had an interesting backdoor.

== Comparison of Vulnerabilities versus Malicious Backdoors ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Criteria
! Vulnerability / “Bugdoor”
! Malicious Backdoor
|-

! Intentional or not?
| Caused by programming mistakes or oversight. Often accidental.
| Planted deliberately by someone with intent to exploit or gain unauthorized access.
|-

! Target specificity?
| Affects many systems. Attackers try to find and exploit them broadly.
| Tailored to specific targets like cryptocurrency wallets or secure servers.
|-

! Evidence?
| Hard to prove intent. May only show unexpected behavior or a crash.
| Clear, readable code that performs harmful or unauthorized actions (e.g. send data to attacker).
|-

! Examples
| Buffer overflow, memory leaks, misconfigured permissions.
| Copay wallet (event-stream), XZ Utils, UnrealIRCd.
|}

A vulnerability becomes a '''malicious backdoor''' when it is not just an accident, but a piece of code '''intentionally''' inserted to exploit systems, steal data, or enable remote control designed to stay hidden until used.

= Hardware Backdoor =
A hidden mechanism intentionally built into hardware that allows unauthorized access or control.

== Hardware Trojan ==
A malicious modification of a hardware design that causes undesired behavior when triggered.

== Firmware Trojan ==
A Trojan embedded in firmware (software on hardware) that manipulates hardware behavior or leaks data.

{{mbox

| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Once a user is infected with very sophisticated malware that modifies low-level firmware, it is extremely difficult to detect in almost all cases.
}}

Firmware infections should not be confused with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_Trojan hardware/circuit trojans], which are malicious modifications made to machine components during the manufacturing process. Despite their sophistication, circuit trojans are not immune to detection. <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_Trojan#Detection</ref>

=== Example Firmware Trojan ===
[https://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack Hard disk hacking by SpritesMods.com]

* A 7-page blog post.
* Custom hack of HDD hardware
* A proof of concept demonstrating how to hack a hard drive (HDD) controller.
* It involves modifying how data is read and written. For example, injecting a username and password into /etc/passwd.
* This creates a persistent backdoor that survives OS reinstallation.
* It is similar to a BIOS backdoor, but implemented in HDD firmware.
* Only root access is required to install this hardware backdoor.
* What is the vulnerability? With root access, it is possible to modify HDD firmware. The hardware vendor is to blame for this.
* It is even possible to run Linux on the HDD controller firmware.

== Virtualizers and Hardware Compromise ==

Virtualizers like Qubes, VirtualBox and KVM cannot absolutely prevent the compromise of hardware. Running all activities inside VMs is a very reasonable approach. However, this only raises the bar and makes it more difficult and/or expensive to compromise the whole system. It is by no means a perfect solution.

No distribution of Linux, BSD, Xen or any other variant can solve the issue of needing to dispose of potentially infected hardware. Hardware-specific issues can really only be fixed at the hardware level. At best, software interventions can only provide workarounds.

== The Promise of Libre Firmware ==

The problem is no hardware exists that consists of entirely Libre firmware. It is very difficult to analyze the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware firmware] of hardware, wipe potentially compromised versions, or [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates|overwrite firmware with a most-likely-clean version]].

Even if a user wholly depended on Libre firmware, this would only make verification easier but it could not stop infection. Disassembling hardware components -- BIOS, disk controllers, CPU, Intel AMT and so on -- and flashing them with clean versions offline is extremely difficult. It is simply cheaper and more convenient to buy new hardware.

The bundling of undesirable anti-features like DRM in closed firmware is further evidence that Libre firmware is needed, in addition to [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.html Libre hardware designs].

A hypothetical stateless computer <ref>https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/12/23/state_harmful.html</ref> <ref>https://github.com/rootkovska/state_harmful/blob/master/state_harmful.md</ref> would solve the problem of malware persistence, but it still could not protect against the damage (data-exfiltration) caused by successful exploitation.

== Circuit Trojan ==
A Trojan embedded at the circuit level, altering logic or functionality of the physical chip.

= Finding Backdoors in Freedom Software vs Non-Freedom Software =
[[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Non-Freedom Software (precompiled binaries) should be avoided.]] because it is easier to hide backdoors. Freedom Software (source-available) should be preferred because it is more difficult to hide backdoors.

| style="background-color: {{Yellow}}"| Depends <ref>Some use obfuscation.</ref>
| {{Yes}} <ref>
An Open Source application binary could be obfuscated in theory. However, depending on the application and the context -- like not being an Open Source obfuscator -- that would be highly suspicious. An Open Source application using obfuscators would probably be criticized in public, get scrutinized, and lose user trust.
</ref>
|-

! Price for security audit searching for backdoors
| style="background-color: {{Red}}"| Very high <ref>
This is because non-freedom software is usually only available as a pre-compiled, possibly obfuscated binary. Using an anti-decompiler:

* Auditors can only look at the disassembly and cannot compare a pre-compiled version from the software vendor with a self-compiled version from source code.
* There is no source code that is well-written, well-commented, and easily readable by design.
</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Green}}"| Lower
|-

! Difference between precompiled version and self-compiled version

! Possibility of catching backdoors via observing incoming/outgoing Internet connections
| style="background-color: {{Yellow}}"| Very difficult <ref name=internet-connections>
This is very difficult because most outgoing connections are encrypted by default. At some point the content must be available to the computer in an unencrypted (plain text) format, but accessing that is not trivial. When running a suspected malicious application, local traffic analyzers like [https://www.wireshark.org/ Wireshark] cannot be trusted. The reason is the malicious application might have compromised the host operating system and be hiding that information from the traffic analyzer or through a backdoor. One possible option might be running the application inside a virtual machine, but many malicious applications actively attempt to detect this configuration. If a virtual machine is identified, they avoid performing malicious activities to avoid being detected. Ultimately this might be possible, but it is still very difficult.
</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Yellow}}"| Very difficult <ref name=internet-connections />
|-

! Convenience of spotting backdoors
| style="background-color: {{Red}}"| Lowest convenience <ref>
It is necessary to decompile the binary and read "gibberish", or try to catch malicious traffic originating from the software under review.

As an example, consider how few people would have decompiled Microsoft Office and kept doing that for every upgrade.
</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Green}}"| Very high convenience <ref>
It is possible to:
# Audit the source code and confirm it is free of backdoors.
# Compare the precompiled binary with a self-built binary and audit the difference. Ideally, and in future, there will be no difference (thanks to the Reproducible Builds project) or only a small difference (due to non-determinism introduced during compilation, such as timestamps).
</ref>
|-

! Difficulty of spotting intentional, malicious backdoors <ref>
An example of a malicious backdoor is a hardcoded username and password or login key only known by the software vendor. In this circumstance there is no plausible deniability for the software vendor.

</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Green}}"| Much lower difficulty <ref>
If for example hardcoded login credentials were in the published source code, that would be easy to spot. If the published source code is different from the actual source code used by the developer to compile the binary, that difference would stand out when comparing pre-compiled binaries from the software vendor with self-compiled binaries by an auditor.

! Effort to audit subsequent releases
| style="background-color: {{Red}}"| Almost same <ref>
It is possible to review the disassembly, but that effort is duplicated for subsequent releases. The disassembly is not optimized to change as little as possible or to be easily understood by humans.

</ref>
| style="background-color: {{Green}}"| Usually lower <ref>
After the initial audit of a source-available binary, it is possible to follow changes in the source code. To audit any newer releases, an auditor can compare the source code of the initially audited version with the new version. Unless there was a huge code refactoring or complete rewrite, the audit effort for subsequent versions is lower.

Spotting backdoors is already very difficult in Freedom Software where the full source code is available to the general public. Spotting backdoors in non-freedom software composed of obfuscated binaries is  exponentially more difficult. <ref>
The consensus is the assembler [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language low level] programming language is more difficult than other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language higher level abstraction] programming languages. Example web search terms: <code>assembler easy</code>, <code>assembler easier</code>, <code>assembler difficult</code>.
</ref> <ref>
Source code written in higher level abstraction programming languages such as C and C++ are compiled to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code object code] using a compiler. See [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiler-and-assembler/ this article] for an introduction and [https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190823140215/compiler.png this image].

Source code written in lower level abstraction programming language assembler is converted to object code using an assembler. See the same article above and [https://contribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/assem.png this image].

Reverse engineering is very difficult for a reasonably complex program that is written in C or C++, where the source code is unavailable; that can be deduced from the high price for it. It is possible to decompile (meaning re-convert) the object code back to C with a decompiler like [http://boomerang.sourceforge.net Boomerang]. To put a price tag on it, consider this quote -- [http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/lostsource.php Boomerang: Help! I've lost my source code]:

<blockquote>How much will it cost?

You should expect to pay a significant amount of money for source recovery. The process is a long and intensive one. Depending on individual circumstances, the quality, quantity and size of artifacts, you can expect to pay upwards of US$15,000 per man-month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Quote research paper [https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pdf Android Mobile OS Snooping By Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Realme Handsets]:

<blockquote>''Reverse Engineering''

A fairly substantial amount of non-trivial reverse engineering is generally required in order to decrypt messages and to at least partially decode the binary plaintext. 1) Handset Rooting: The first step is to gain a shell on the handset with elevated privileges, i.e. in the case of Android to root the handset. This allows us then to (i) obtain copies of the system apps and their data, (ii) use a debugger to instrument and modify running apps (e.g. to extract encryption keys from memory and bypass security checks), and (iii) install a trusted SSL root certificate to allow HTTPS decryption, as we explain below. Rooting typically requires unlocking the bootloader to facilitate access to the so-called fastboot mode, disabling boot image verification and patching the system image. Unlocking the bootloader is often the hardest of these steps, since many handset manufacturers discourage bootloader unlocking. Some, such as Oppo, go so far as to entirely remove fastboot mode (the relevant code is not compiled into the bootloader). The importance of this is that it effectively places a constraint on the handset manufacturers/ mobile OSes that we can analyse. Xiaomi and Realme provide special tools to unlock the bootloader, with Xiaomi requiring registering user details and waiting a week before unlocking. Huawei require a handset-specific unlock code, but no longer supply such codes. To unlock the bootloader on the Huawei handset studied here, we needed to open the case and short the test point pads on the circuit board, in order to boot the device into the Huawei equivalent of Qualcomm’s Emergency Download (EDL) mode. In EDL mode, the bootloader itself can be patched to reset the unlock code to a known value (we used a commercial service for this), and thereby enable unlocking of the bootloader.</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Decompiling and Instrumentation''

On a rooted handset, the Android application packages (APKs) of the apps on the /system disk partition can be extracted, unzipped and decompiled. While the bytecode of Android Java apps can be readily decompiled, the code is almost always deliberately obfuscated in order to deter reverse engineering. As a result, reverse engineering the encryption and binary encoding in an app can feel a little like exploring a darkened maze. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is frequently a time-consuming process, even for experienced researchers/practitioners. It is often very helpful to connect to a running system app using a debugger, so as to view variable values, extract encryption keys from memory, etc.</blockquote>

The research paper describes in far more detail the highly complicated technical challenges of reverse engineering.
</ref>

To further improve the situation in the future, the Freedom Software community is working on the [https://reproducible-builds.org/ Reproducible Builds] project. Quote:

<blockquote>Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free and open source software for malicious flaws, most software is distributed pre-compiled with no method to confirm whether they correspond.

This incentivises attacks on developers who release software, not only via traditional exploitation, but also in the forms of political influence, blackmail or even threats of violence.

This is particularly a concern for developers collaborating on privacy or security software: attacking these typically result in compromising particularly politically-sensitive targets such as dissidents, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as anyone wishing to communicate securely under a repressive regime.

Whilst individual developers are a natural target, it additionally encourages attacks on build infrastructure as an successful attack would provide access to a large number of downstream computer systems. By modifying the generated binaries here instead of modifying the upstream source code, illicit changes are essentially invisible to its original authors and users alike.

The motivation behind the Reproducible Builds project is therefore to allow verification that no vulnerabilities or backdoors have been introduced during this compilation process. By promising identical results are always generated from a given source, this allows multiple third parties to come to a consensus on a “correct” result, highlighting any deviations as suspect and worthy of scrutiny.

This ability to notice if a developer has been compromised then deters such threats or attacks occurring in the first place as any compromise would be quickly detected. This offers comfort to front-liners that they not only can be threatened, but they would not be coerced into exploiting or exposing their colleagues or end-users.

[https://reproducible-builds.org/who/ Several free software projects] already, or will soon, provide reproducible builds.</blockquote>
