This wiki page documents how to install different versions of VirtualBox from sources other than the default repositories, such as Debian unstable or directly from the developers of VirtualBox.

= Security Considerations =

If using {{project_name_long}} inside a {{VM}}, the virtualization platform is an essential component of a secure {{project_name_long}} system. A vulnerable virtualizer may provide opportunities for attackers to perform a breakout from a virtual machine in order to undo the security by isolation features that {{project_name_long}} provides. The decision to install an alternative virtualizer should not be taken lightly.

The two methods described below to install VirtualBox are safer than downloading, verifying, and installing binaries manually.

See also [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended VirtualBox version]].

Was not possible as of Debian <code>buster</code>. Dependencies such as for package <code>glibc</code> were too new. This meant a host of updated dependencies from Debian unstable wer pulled and mixed with Debian stable, often leading to many issues including system instability.

'''Option <u>B</u>''': Manually add VirtualBox.org APT Repository.

Please press on expand on the right.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

'''Step 1''' Add the Oracle apt sources list.

Make sure to change <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to the current name of your stable distribution.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/virtualbox-archive-keyring.asc] https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -sc) contrib" {{!}} sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list

'''2.''' {{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update

'''3.''' Install VirtualBox and Linux Kernel Headers, which are a dependency.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install virtualbox-6.1 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
}}

'''4.''' Update VirtualBox guest additions.

<u>Note</u>: After upgrading the VirtualBox host version, this might cause issues with the guest VMs such as broken VM size adjustment (full screen) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-upgrading-whonix-cannot-full-size-whonix-workstation-screen/9647/16 Problems after upgrading {{project_name_long}} - cannot full size {{project_name_long}} screen]
</ref> unless the VirtualBox guest additions are also upgraded inside your virtual machine.

To upgrade, at time of writing 11 September 2022, as of VirtualBox version <code>6.1.38</code> [[VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#Migration_to_Oracle_Style_VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Migration to Oracle Style VirtualBox Guest Additions]] is recommended.

'''5.''' Done.

Installation of VirtualBox from VirtualBox.org Repository has been completed.
