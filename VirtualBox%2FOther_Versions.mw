This wiki page documents how to install different versions of VirtualBox from sources other than the default repositories, such as Debian unstable or directly from the developers of VirtualBox.

= Security Considerations =

If using {{project_name_long}} inside a {{VM}}, the virtualization platform is an essential component of a secure {{project_name_long}} system. A vulnerable virtualizer may provide opportunities for attackers to perform a breakout from a virtual machine in order to undo the security by isolation features that {{project_name_long}} provides. The decision to install an alternative virtualizer should not be taken lightly.

The two methods described below to install VirtualBox are safer than downloading, verifying, and installing binaries manually.

See also [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended VirtualBox version]].

{{Anchor|Install from Oracle Repository}}

Choose the instillation source, either Install from VirtualBox.org Repository or Install VirtualBox from Debian Unstable.

'''2.''' Learn more about, acquire the [[VirtualBox/Installer|Use VirtualBox Installer by {{project_name_short}} Developers]].

'''3.''' Run it with with option <code>--oracle-repo</code>.

This will result in installation of VirtualBox from the Oracle (<code>VirtualBox.org</code> repository).

{{CodeSelect|code=
bash ./virtualbox-installer --oracle-repo
}}

'''4.''' Review the output of the VirtualBox Installer.

'''5.''' VirtualBox installation complete.

'''6.''' Move on to step C below.

}}

'''Step 3''' Paste at the end.

{{CodeSelect|code=

The following comments in that file...
<pre>
# - contrib

'''Step 4''' Save and exit.

'''Step 5''' Use extrepo to enable the VirtualBox.org APT repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo extrepo enable virtualbox
}}

If everything goes well, extrepo will just print some empty lines.

'''Step 6''' Done.

Adding the VirtualBox.org APT repository has been completed.

'''Step A''' Add the Oracle apt sources list.

Make sure to change <code>{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}</code> to the current name of your stable distribution.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/virtualbox-archive-keyring.asc] https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -sc) contrib" {{!}} sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list

'''Step B''' Add Oracle's signing key to APT keyring.

'''2.''' Update and Install VirtualBox.

'''A.''' {{Update}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update

'''B.''' Install VirtualBox and Linux Kernel Headers, which are a dependency.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install virtualbox-7.1 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
}}
</div>
</div>

'''C.''' Update VirtualBox guest additions.

<u>Note</u>: After upgrading the VirtualBox host version, this '''might''' cause issues with the guest VMs such as broken VM size adjustment (full screen) <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-upgrading-whonix-cannot-full-size-whonix-workstation-screen/9647/16 Problems after upgrading {{project_name_short}} - cannot full size {{project_name_short}} screen]

This is currently not the case at time of writing in August 2023. If this happens, then you could try [[VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#Migration_to_Oracle_Style_VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Migration to Oracle Style VirtualBox Guest Additions]].

'''D.''' Done.

Installation of VirtualBox from VirtualBox.org Repository has been completed.
