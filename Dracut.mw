* Note: If bugs are closed, it does not automatically mean that the fix has already reached the user's distribution's APT repository or that the bug has been fixed indeed. In some cases, bugs that were once fixed have been reverted by upstream and re-introduced. This makes finding out the current status of bugs very difficult.
