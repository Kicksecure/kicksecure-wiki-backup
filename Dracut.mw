To check your currently installed initrd generator, see [[Dracut#Find_out_which_initrd_Generator_is_installed|Find out which initrd Generator is installed]].

'''2.''' Warning.

* '''Backups:''' Always maintain backups and proceed with caution when making changes.
* '''Dracut bug reports:''' If issues with <code>dracut</code> occur, do not report them here, as they are [[unspecific|unrelated to {{project_name_short}}]].

= Bugs =
* '''Specific risk:''' Issues may occur during migration to <code>dracut</code> if full disk encryption is used.
** <u>Likely issues:</u>
*** Package <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code> is not installed.
*** <code>hostonly=yes</code> configuration option is not used.
** <u>Workaround:</u> If boot fails: setting the kernel parameter <code>rd.auto</code> might help. (Tested on Debian <code>12</code>/ <code>bookworm</code>.)
* <u>Note on bug status:</u> Closed bugs do not necessarily mean the issue is resolved in your distribution's APT repository. Fixes may have been reverted upstream, making bug status verification difficult.
* <u><code>dracut</code> (abandoned)</u>
