== Special Notices ==
Currently none.

== Frozen Packages ==

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = As {{project_name_short}} is based on the stable Debian distribution, software is normally [https://release.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/freeze_policy.html "frozen" to the stable Debian version] at the [https://www.debian.org/releases/ point of each major Debian release]. The Debian packages page notes: <ref>
https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages
</ref>

{{Quotation
|quote=This is the latest official release of the Debian distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.
}}
}}

As a distribution, Debian's compilation of software is mostly acquired from "upstream" third parties (the original software vendors). Debian has embraced the principle of software stability, which means each major release "freezes" software versions. As a result, the stable distribution software is not regularly updated except for critical security fixes. This is called "security support" and only leads to minimal changes across the entire distribution. The intent is to improve stability by reducing the overall number of system changes.

The frozen packages policy means the versions of software installed from Debian package sources will not usually change when a newer release is made available by upstream. <ref>

== Update Notifications by updatecheck ==
See also [[systemcheck]] chapter [[Systemcheck#Update_Notifications_by_updatecheck|Update Notifications by updatecheck]].

== Application Specific Update Indicators ==
In most cases, specific end-user applications such as [[electrum]] show notifications about the availability of newer versions. These can be safely ignored since Electrum is also a [[#Frozen Packages|Frozen Package]]. No manual user action is required. To receive security advisories in special cases that do require manual user action, see [[Stay_Tuned|Follow {{project_name_short}} Developments]].

Application-specific update indicators should not be shown to the user and should be disabled by Debian. This is a bug that should not happen. It is occurring due to the [[Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems|organisational background]].

== Standard Update vs Release Upgrade ==

There are two different types of updates.

# '''Standard Update'''
# '''Release Upgrade'''

The procedure on this wiki page is for ''standard'' ("everyday") updating of {{project_name_short}} and will not perform a [[Release Upgrade]].

It is recommended to first complete a [[#Standard_Update_Steps|standard update]] before applying a release upgrade.

== Update vs Image Re-Installation ==

The [[#Standard_Update_Steps|standard ("everyday") update]] procedure for {{non_q_project_name_short}} is more convenient than a complete re-installation of {{project_name_short}} images because all (VM) settings and user data are persistent. If using VMs, backups are possible using (VM) clones and/or snapshots.

In contrast, a complete re-installation of {{project_name_short}} images requires {{project_name_short}} to be completely removed and then re-installed, similar to newcomers installing the platform for the first time. This is "cleaner" and elaborated on the [[Factory Reset]] page. Obviously, all (VM) settings and data are lost during this procedure. If this is necessary, follow these steps:

* <u>[[{{non_q_project_name_short}}|{{non_q_project_name_short}}]]</u>: remove any {{project_name_short}} (VMs) and then re-install them.
* <u>[[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]]</u>: [[Qubes/Uninstall|uninstall {{q_project_name_short}}]] and then [[Qubes/Install|install {{q_project_name_short}}]].

Developers periodically announce a newer {{project_name_short}} [[Point Release]] or major release. To stay informed about releases, see: [[Stay Tuned|Follow {{project_name_short}} Developments]]. It is recommended to subscribe to relevant news channels for this purpose.

Standard updates are generally easier, but image re-installation can completely avoid [[Dev/Stateless|technical issues]] that might emerge during upgrades.

Should a standard upgrade or in-place release upgrade not be possible, in other words, should a complete re-installation ever be required for security-critical reasons, a special announcement would be posted.

}}

'''3.''' Ignore if the fasttrack repository cannot be updated.

This is OK because package lists for other repositories will still be updated.

'''4.''' Continue upgrading as usual according to the instructions on this wiki page generally.

{{CodeSelect|code=

== Release File Expired Error ==
Same as below.

== InRelease is not valid yet error ==

A release file expired error can look like this.

<pre>
E: Release file for tor+https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian/dists/bookworm-fasttrack/InRelease is not valid yet (invalid for another 49s). Updates for this repository will not be applied.
</pre>

'''1.''' '''Retry.'''

If this message is transient, it can be safely ignored. Try again later. There is a good chance that it has been resolved.

'''2.''' '''Platform Specific Notice'''

* <u>Kicksecure:</u> No special steps required. See below.
* <u>Qubes:</u> If using Qubes, try [[#Standard Update Steps|Standard Update Steps]] instead of the Qubes update tool.

'''3.''' '''Check your system clock.'''

This issue can occur if your system clock is too fast.

Check if the date and time are correct. For instructions, see [[Network_Time_Synchronization|Network Time Synchronization]].

After making sure that your system clock is correct, retry.

== does not have a Release file ==
<pre>
E: The repository 'tor+deb.kicksecure.com bookworm Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

100% uptime should not be expected. See also [[Trust#Server_Downtime|server downtime]].

'''2.''' '''Retry.'''

If this message is transient, it can be safely ignored. Try again later. There is a good chance that is has been resolved.

== APT Hash Sum Mismatch ==

A hash sum mismatch can look like this.

<pre>
W: Failed to fetch https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/i18n/Translation-enIndex  Hash Sum mismatch
</pre>

This might occur due to Tor and/or network unreliability issues. If this warning message is transient, it can be safely ignored. Otherwise, try one of the fixes below.
# [[Tor_Controller#Nyx|Change the Tor circuit]] and/or try again later.
# If the warning message still persists, deleting the package lists should solve it. <ref>
https://askubuntu.com/questions/41605/trouble-downloading-updates-due-to-hash-sum-mismatch-error
</ref>

To delete the package lists, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo safe-rm -r -f -- /var/lib/apt/lists/*
}}

To check everything is functional, update the package lists and then upgrade the distribution. It is likely that previous update/upgrade attempts failed due to the mismatch.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
}}

== Non-functional Onion Services ==

{{Non-functional Onion Services}}

== Broken APT ==
This chapter is dedicated to providing a series of commands that can help in fixing a broken APT system. However, it's important to note that these steps might not resolve all cases of broken APT.

'''1.''' Relation to Debian.

Since [[Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_short}} is based on Debian]], the methods to fix broken APT are also [[unspecific|applicable to {{project_name_short}}]].

'''2.''' Interactive vs Non-interactive Commands.

For each troubleshooting step, two types of commands are provided. Choose one. No need to use both.

* '''A)''' <u>Interactive</u>: Commands without the <code>-noninteractive</code> suffix.
* '''B)''' <u>Non-interactive</u>: Commands with the <code>-noninteractive</code> suffix, available in Kicksecure to avoid user prompts.

'''3.''' Update the Package Lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''4.''' Resolve Incomplete DPKG Processes.

Since APT uses DPKG internally, ensure to complete any interrupted DPKG processes:

* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg --configure -a
}}
* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-noninteractive --configure -a
}}

'''5.''' Address Interrupted APT Processes.

To continue any interrupted APT processes:

* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install -f
}}
* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get-noninteractive install -f
}}

'''6.''' Address Interrupted APT Processes.

To continue any interrupted APT processes:

* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt full-upgrade -f
}}
* {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt-get-noninteractive full-upgrade -f
}}

'''7.''' Run a DPKG audit.

The following command does not fix anything but might return error messages which might be helpful to resolve this issue.

* {{CodeSelect|code=
dpkg --audit
}}

* If the command outputs nothing, then this is a good sign.
* If the command outputs something, then you need to address this.

'''8.''' Additional Steps for Persistent Issues.

If the issue persists, consult the [[Self Support First Policy]] and consider enhancing this documentation.

https://www.kali.org/docs/troubleshooting/handling-common-apt-errors/

= Advanced =
== Non-Torified Updates ==
[[About#torified_updates|By {{project_name_short}} default, all updates are torified, which is a security feature.]]

To optionally update without Tor, apply the following instructions.

{{Testers-only}}

'''1.''' Platform specific notice:

* {{project_name_short}}: No special notice.
* Whonix: These instructions won't work for Whonix (a derivative of Kicksecure).

'''2.''' Configure {{project_name_short}} APT sources to use plain TLS.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo repository-dist --transport plain-tls
}}

'''3.''' Configure Debian APT sources to use plain TLS.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo str_replace "tor+https" "https" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
}}

'''4.''' Notice.

These instructions are not an absolute prevention of never using Tor.

Optional: To avoid ever using Tor, system Tor needs to be removed.

Note: Understanding [[Debian Packages|meta packages]] is required.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt purge tor
}}

'''5.''' Done.

The process of setting up non-torified (clearnet TLS) updates has been completed.
