{{intro|
There are many issues which might prevent a normal operation of the VirtualBox host virtualization software. This wiki page documents common issues and potential solutions.
}}
Topics on this page are sorted roughly in order of issue prevalence. More common issues are on top.

= Linux Host Kernel versus Tor Browser and other Crashes =
This issue happens after a Linux host kernel upgrade. Common symptoms of this issue are:

* APT showing <code>hashsum mismatch</code>.
* {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Kernel#Kernel_Issues
|text=other kernel issues
}}
* Tor Browser crashes.

<pre>
ERROR: Tor Browser ended with non-zero (error) exit code!

Tor Browser was started with:

/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser --verbose --allow-remote .

Tor Browser exited with code: 139
</pre>

This is fixed since VirtualBox version <code>6.1.36</code> and above. For installation instructuctions, see [[VirtualBox/Recommended Version|recommended VirtualBox version]].

= Failed to open a session for the virtual machine =
If you see the following error message:

<blockquote>Failed to open a session for the virtual machine {{project_name_short}}-Xfce</blockquote>

Click details. If <code>Result Code:</code> <code>NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)</code> is shown, then this chapter applies.

Should be fixed in VirtualBox version <code>6.1.22</code> and above.

This occurs with all {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox versions up to version <code>15.0.1.7.2</code> when using VirtualBox version <code>6.1.20</code>. VirtualBox version <code>6.1.20</code> solution:

* <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Storage</code> &rarr; <code>Type:</code> <code>AHCI</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> <ref>
For reasons, see [[Dev/VirtualBox#Storage_Controller_Setting|Storage Controller Setting]].
</ref>
* Other settings remain unchanged.

This setting is the default in {{project_name_short}} version <code>15.0.1.7.3</code> and above ([[Point Release]]).

Note this setting <u>might</u> cause [[#High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption|High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption]] on some (slower) hardware configurations due to a VirtualBox host software bug, [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031 High I/O causing filesystem corruption]. This is speculation and unavoidable because there is no other solution at present. The [[#High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption|High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption]] chapter has approaches which might fix this issue if it manifests.

To avoid issues like <code>Failed to open a session for the virtual machine</code> in the future, use the the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended]] version of the VirtualBox host software and [[Stay Tuned]].

= VT-x =

== VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE ==

If the "{{Code2|Failed to load unit 'PATM' (VERR_SSM_FIELD_NOT_CONSECUTIVE).}}" error appears, <code>VT-x</code> must be enabled in BIOS settings, see [[#BIOS|instructions]].

{{Anchor|VT-x_is_disabled_in_the_BIOS.}}
{{Anchor|VT-x}}

== VT-x is disabled in BIOS ==

If the following error message appears.

== VT-x / SVM Errors ==
[[File:Enable-vt-x-in-bios.png|thumb|enabling VT-x in BIOS]]
<!-- Same as: https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Enable_VT-x_in_BIOS -->

These errors arise when the host's hardware virtualization extension is not available. The reasons are either/and/or:

* '''A)''' it is controlled by another hypervisor running on the system,
* '''B)''' an anti-virus suite or
* '''C)''' it is not present/enabled by the machine BIOS.

To check, go to your BIOS settings. For basic instructions, see: [https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings How to Change Computer BIOS Settings].

Then enable <code>VT-x</code>. This is sometimes also called <code>AMD-V</code>, <code>virtualization</code>, <code>SVM mode</code> or <code>MIT</code> perhaps under <code>Advanced Core</code> settings.

= Updating/Upgrading while VM are Running =

== Error In supR3HardenedWinReSpawn ==
{{ContentImage|
[[File:VirtualBox_supR3HardenedWinReSpawn.png|400px]]
}}

Do not update whilst the VM are running, otherwise [[VirtualBox]] must be reinstalled.

== VMMR0InitVM: Revision mismatch ==

<pre>
debian kernel: VMMR0InitVM: Revision mismatch, r3=132055 r0=130347
</pre>

This happens when upgrading VirtualBox on the host while existing VM are still running. The solution is to shut down and restart all VM.

= Disk Space =

== E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057) ==

This '''might''' relate to a '''low disk space issue''' -- [[Unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] -- [[Please_Use_Search_Engines_And_See_Documentation_First|research the issue further with search engines]].

A user reported:

<blockquote>During Import, on Application Settings pop up. Setting called "Additional Options: __ Import hard drives as VDI". Unselecting this got me past this error.</blockquote>

This might be the case because if no conversion to VDI is required that less disk space might be sufficient.

= Non-functional Shared Clipboard and Drag and Drop =

If the shared clipboard and drag’n’drop to/from host is non-functional, this can relate to the version of guest additions installed in {{project_name_short}} and/or the version of VirtualBox running on the host. <ref>
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-15-shared-clipboard-and-dragndrop-not-working/7723

# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>General</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced tab</code> &rarr; <code>'Check' shared clipboard and drag and drop</code>

It might still not work, see: [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_Bugs|VirtualBox Guest Additions Bugs Reporting]].

= Screen Issues =

== Screen Resolution Bug ==

{{Anchor|VirtualBox Screen Resolution Bug}}

[[File:cli4.png|thumb|VirtualBox Screen Resolution Bug]]
[[File:cli3.png|thumb|Normal presentation]]

If the display presents like the image on the right-hand side, then you are affected by a screen resolution bug which only occurs in VirtualBox.

To correct the resolution, first apply the [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#General_VirtualBox_Troubleshooting_Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]].

If the issue still persists, try one of the following workarounds to correct the resolution.

'''VirtualBox Virtual Screen Menu Workaround'''

# Power off the VM.
# Restart the VM.
# Maximize the VM window after start of the VM as soon as possible.
# <code>VirtualBox VM Window</code> &rarr; <code>View</code> &rarr; <code>Virtual Screen 1</code> &rarr; <code>Choose any, resize to another resolution</code>
# <code>VirtualBox VM Window</code> &rarr; <code>View</code> &rarr; <code>Auto-resize Guest Display</code>
-----
'''Desktop Resolution Settings Workaround'''

If the method above did not work, another option is the following. Inside the virtual machine:

<code>Xfce Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Resolution:</code> &rarr; <code>Choose a higher resolution resolution</code> &rarr; <code>Apply</code>
-----
'''VirtualBox VMSVGA Graphics Controller Setting Workaround'''

If it still does not work, a final option is the following.

Inside the virtual machine <ref>
VirtualBox VMSVGA graphics controller is based on the VMware graphics controller.
</ref>:

On the host:

# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>VMSVGA</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (This is already the case in newer {{project_name_short}} versions.)
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>increase slider for Video Memory to 128</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (This is already the case in newer {{project_name_short}} versions.)
# Restart the VM.
# Maximize the VM window after start of the VM as soon as possible.
# If necessary, try again one of above workarounds.
-----
'''VirtualBox Guest Additions Bugs Reporting'''

Occasionally screen resolution problems might still persist, see: [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_Bugs|VirtualBox Guest Additions Bugs Reporting]].

== Black Screen ==
If a black screen appears, try the following possible solutions.

# Install the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended]] version of the VirtualBox host software.
# Apply the [[#General_VirtualBox_Troubleshooting_Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]].
# Reboot.
# If the issue persists, try the following workarounds.

If this solution or any of the workarounds worked for you, please report this in [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_short}} forums].

-----

'''Workaround 1: Try Other VirtualBox Virtual Graphics Controller Settings'''
# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>VMSVGA</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (Or try other settings there.) <ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=

# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>increase slider for Video Memory to 128</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code> (This is already the default in recent releases of {{project_name_short}}.)
# Restart the VM.

-----

'''Workaround 2:  Boot Once Without Virtual Graphics Adapter'''

This workaround has been reported as functional on a Windows 10 host with both Intel and nVidia GPU capabilities. It is okay to try this workaround on any host operating system.

# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Display</code> &rarr; <code>Graphics Controller</code> &rarr; <code>None</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Start the VM. Wait 2-3 minutes. ''(Since the display is disabled, you will see nothing happening)''
# Click the VirtualBox pane's <code>[X]</code> button. VirtualBox will offer a dialog with 3 options. If <code>Send Shutdown signal</code> is greyed out, cancel the dialog and try this step again every 10-20 seconds.
# Send Shutdown signal. If it does not shut down immediately, wait a short time and try again.
# Once the VM shuts down, restore the Graphics Controller to <code>VMSVGA</code>.
# Restart the VM.

''If this workaround succeeds, the screen will again be black for 2-3 minutes, but then <code>chkdsk</code> will run and the VM should start normally.''

-----

'''Workaround 3: nomodeset Kernel Parameter'''

Try to [[Grub#Kernel_Boot_Parameter_Change|boot with the <code>nomodeset</code> kernel parameter]]. If that works, please post a forum report and then [[Grub#Permanent_Configuration_Changes|make the change permanent]]. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-cli-15-0-0-9-4-gateway-shows-a-black-screen/9174/2
</ref>

'''Workaround 4: Virtual Console'''

If it is possible to switch to a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]], this can help with debugging.

== Slow Video Playback ==

Possible solutions:

# <u>Untested</u>: Try downloading a video using [https://whonix.org/wiki/yt-dlp yt-dlp] ([http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/yt-dlp .onion]) and then play the video in VLC.
# <u>Tested</u>: Consider [[Tuning]], specifically [[Tuning#Hardware-accelerated_Graphics|enable hardware-accelerated graphics]]. Note that this configuration worsens security.
# <u>Untested</u>: Consider [[Tuning#Disable_CPU_Mitigations|disabling CPU mitigations]]. This configuration also worsens security.

It is unknown whether enabling VirtualBox hardware-accelerated graphics (3D Acceleration) or disabling CPU mitigations is worse for security. Contributors are asked to research this issue ([[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]]) and report what is found in a dedicated forum thread.

= Miscellaneous =
== Host Crash ==

See the [[#Aborted Status|Aborted Status]] instructions below.

== Aborted Status ==

If the virtual machine ever shows an <code>aborted</code> status, perform these steps:

# Try to [[#Assign Less Virtual CPUs|Assign Less Virtual CPUs]]; this may help to avoid the issue.
# Check for [[Troubleshooting#Low_RAM_Issues|Low RAM issues]].
# Apply [[#General_VirtualBox_Troubleshooting_Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]].
# Consider reporting a bug against upstream [https://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox] -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker VirtualBox bugtracker] / [https://forums.virtualbox.org VirtualBox forums]. <u>VirtualBox developers</u> require logs to identify the problem. <ref name=vbox-logs>
[https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=77663#p361694 Reasons of vm to get into "aborted" state]:

<blockquote>
Would you mind sharing with us one of those logs so that we can judge for ourselves? From a machine that got aborted? ZIP it before using the "Upload attachment" at the bottom of your reply form.
</blockquote>
</ref>

{{project_name_short}} provides VM image that operate inside of the VM. Whatever occurs inside a VM should never lead to a crash (status aborted) of the host virtualization software, VirtualBox.

Recommended steps:

# To capture the VirtualBox log: <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>right click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Show Log...</code> &rarr; <code>Log</code> &rarr; <code>Save</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>
# Zip the log.
# Report to <u>VirtualBox support</u>.
# Share the VirtualBox support request link in {{project_name_short}} forums.

== Guru Mediation ==

{{project_name_short}} provides VM image that operate inside of the VM. Whatever occurs inside a VM should never lead to a Guru Mediation of the host virtualization software, VirtualBox.

Posting a screenshot of the Guru Mediation screen is probably not required since these all look very similar. <ref>
http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fixedbyvonnie-virtualbox-guru-meditation.png
</ref>

<blockquote>VirtualBox Guru Meditation

A critical error has occurred while running the virtual machine and the machine execution has been stopped.

For help, please see the Community section on https://www.virtualbox.org or your support contract. Please provide the contents of the log file VBox.log and the image file VBox.png, which you can find in the /home/sk/VirtualBox VMs/Ubuntu 20.04 Server/Logs directory, as well as a description of what you were doing when this error happened. Note that you can also access the above files by selecting Show Log from the Machine menu of the main VirtualBox window.

Press OK if you want to power off the machine or press Ignore if you want to leave it as is for debugging. Please note that debugging requires special knowledge and tools, so it is recommended to press OK now.</blockquote>

This example text does not contain any technical details which could help to fix the issue, since VirtualBox Guru Meditation can occur for many reasons.

Recommended steps to resolve VirtualBox Guru Meditation issues:

'''1.''' Apply [[#General_VirtualBox_Troubleshooting_Steps|General VirtualBox Troubleshooting Steps]].

These often help resolving such issues.

'''2.''' Capture the VirtualBox log

Without log contents, developers will probably be unable to help.

<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>right click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Show Log...</code> &rarr; <code>Log</code> &rarr; <code>Save</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

'''3.''' Consider inspecting the log yourself.

Use search engines to try and locate any similar or identical error messages. Usually the issue will already have been reported, and a solution might be documented in the same place. It is recommended to search the offical VirtualBox website because most VirtualBox developers and experts will utilize this resource. The following search term will limit search results to the VirtualBox website (this is a feature which most search engines support): <code>site:virtualbox.org error message here</code>. <ref>Replace <code>error message here</code> with the issue being investigated.</ref>

'''4.''' Consider reporting a bug against upstream [https://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox].

* Zip the log.
* Post the log at [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker VirtualBox bugtracker] or [https://forums.virtualbox.org VirtualBox forums].
* <u>VirtualBox developers</u> require logs to investigate the problem. <ref name=vbox-logs />

'''5.''' Share the VirtualBox support request link in {{project_name_short}} forums.

'''6.''' Done.

Hopefully help can be provided.

== NS_ERROR_FAILURE ==
<pre>
NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)
</pre>

[https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=87306 Quote VirtualBox forum moderator]

<blockquote>NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005) is a general failure message when loading a VM. Subsequent lines in the error dialog will give the exact cause of the error. You do NOT have the same error just because you see the generic leader. If you don't provide a log or the supplemental error description then we can't help you.</blockquote>

While this is not the same error as Guru Mediation, all the same information and advice from that chapter applies. Therefore please follow chapter [[#Guru Mediation|Guru Mediation]].

== Kernel driver not installed ==

[[File:Virtualbox kernel driver not installed.png|thumb|error happening in case Linux kernel headers package (<code>linux-headers-amd64</code>) is missing]]

[[File:Virtualbox kernel driver not installed vboxconfig.png|thumb|output of <code>sudo vboxconfig</code> in case Linux kernel headers package (<code>linux-headers-amd64</code>) is missing]]

<code>Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)</code>

If this occurs on Linux based host operating systems, then it is likely the Linux headers package matching the currently running Linux image package is not installed. To attempt to fix the issue:

'''1.''' Go to the [[VirtualBox/Recommended Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version]] wiki page.

'''2.''' Press the expand button for your operating system.

If you Linux, press the Expand button on that wiki page.

Once expanded, the recommended instructions will explain how to install VirtualBox for select Linux distributions as well as generic recommendations for other Linux distributions.

'''4.''' Apply the installation instructions from that wiki page.

'''5.''' Issue resolved?

This issue is unspecific to {{project_name_short}}. Any VM from any vendor and/or self-created VM will fail to start, not just {{project_name_short}} VM. This is because it is a host operating system and VirtualBox issue. If the instructions above did not fix the issue, then try accessing further support resources including the [[#Testing with a Debian VM|Testing with a Debian VM]] chapter.

'''6.''' Support requests.

For support requests, please provide the following debug output. Is package <code>linux-headers-amd64</code> installed? To check, run:

<pre>
dpkg -l | grep linux-headers-amd64
</pre>

Is package <code>linux-image-amd64</code> installed? To check, run:

<pre>
dpkg -l | grep linux-image-amd64

== Assign Less Virtual CPUs ==

Try assigning less virtual CPUs. <ref>
VirtualBox ticket: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/19500 VirtualBox should now prohibit assigning all physical CPUs to a VM and/or fix VirtualBox CPU assignment manual].
</ref>

In {{project_name_short}} <code>15.0.1.3.4</code> and above <code>3</code> virtual CPUs is now the default setting; <code>4</code> were previously used. As a result, this workaround should no longer be required for most users.

# Power off the VM.
# <code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>click a VM</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Processor</code> &rarr; <code>Reduce to 3</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

== INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN GRAIN TABLE AND BACKUP GRAIN TABLE ==

If this error appears, sometimes it helps to:

# Try and convert the <code>vmdk</code> to <code>vdi</code>.
# Remove the old <code>vmdk</code> from the VM.
# Attach the new <code>vdi</code>.

== High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption ==

This is a VirtualBox host software bug, [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031 High I/O causing filesystem corruption].

The following settings cannot fix already existing filesystem corruption inside the virtual harddrive. However, these settings <u>might</u> prevent future filesystem corruption. Therefore the best time to experiment with these settings is before starting a virtual machine for the first time or at least before issues appear.

Enabling <code>Host I/O Cache</code> <u>might</u> help as it was [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031#comment:22 reported by a user on the VirtualBox issue tracker].

<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Storage</code> &rarr; <code>Name:</code> <code>SATA</code> &rarr; <code>Type:</code> <code>AHCI</code> &rarr; enable <code>Use Host I/O Cache</code> &rarr; <code>OK</code>

Experimenting with other virtual machine hardware settings might also help.

<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Storage</code> &rarr; <code>Name:</code> &rarr; experiment with other settings &rarr; <code>OK</code>

Maybe <code>Type:</code> <code>virtio-scsi</code> could help.

Other settings that might help:

<blockquote>Try to tune host os page flusher behavior to avoid accumulating of significant amount of dirty pages in host file system buffers. For example, set vm.dirty_background_ratio to 5 or below (this is still large size - about 1Gb) or set vm.dirty_background_bytes to something smaller like 20971520 to make page flusher more active. Note that this may make host file system cache less effective, but it prevents write operation stuck during buffer flush.</blockquote>

= Testing with a Debian VM =
{{Anchor|Test a non-{{project_name_short}} VM}}

Before diving into issues related to {{project_name_short}}, it's a good idea to first ensure that the underlying platform and software are functioning correctly.

# Start by testing the VirtualBox host software as if you've never encountered {{project_name_short}}. This will give you a baseline.
# As a next step, try using a VM that isn't based on {{project_name_short}}. A good candidate would be Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.
# If you continue to face issues with the Debian VM, it indicates that the problem isn't specific to {{project_name_short}}. Such issues that are [[unspecific]] to {{project_name_short}} should be tackled according to these guidelines:

= VirtualBox Generic Bug Reproduction =

This entry is based on [[Reporting_Bugs#Bug_Report_Recommendations|Bug Report Recommendations]], specifically [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]]. The content is similar to the [[#Testing with a Debian VM|Testing with a Debian VM]] chapter above.

The following is a manual reproduction of the [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Integration|{{project_name_short}} VirtualBox Integration]].

'''1.''' Host operating system choice.

Use the [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Host_Operating_System_Selection#Recommended_Linux_Distribution recommended] ([http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Host_Operating_System_Selection .onion]) Linux distribution. Either,

* '''A)''' [https://www.debian.org/ Debian] <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> "<code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>", <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Debian <code>testing</code>.

Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> is preferable.

See also [[Debian Tips]].

During installation, preferably choose the same desktop environment that {{project_name_short}} is using, which is Xfce at time of writing.

'''2.''' Install the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended version of the VirtualBox host software]] and follow the instructions from that wiki page.

'''3.''' Install Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> inside a VirtualBox VM.

'''4.''' Install the VirtualBox Guest Additions inside the VirtualBox VM.

Choose either option '''A)''' <u>or</u> '''B)'''.

'''NOTE:''' This works only when using Debian <code>testing</code>.

'''A)''' Inside the VirtualBox VM.

Open a terminal.

'''B)''' Add APT pinning preferences.

The purpose of this is to install only as few applications from Debian <code>unstable</code> as possible.

1) {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/preferences.d/40-pinning
}}

2) Paste the following content.

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

'''5.''' Attempt to reproduce the original issue.

* '''A)''' If the original issue is reproducible: That means the root issue is not caused by {{project_name_short}}. In other words, the issue is [[unspecific]] to {{project_name_short}}. In that case it is recommended to try and resolve the issue as per [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]]. If a solution was found, please consider editing the [[Documentation|{{project_name_short}} Documentation]] as a contribution and/or providing a complete answer in the {{project_name_short}} User Forums.
* '''B)''' If the original issue is not reproducible: Please report this in [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_short}} forums].

= Submit a Bug Report =

When reporting an issue in the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} {{project_name_short}} forums], please add the exact steps which led to the problem. Also include as much relevant information as possible; see below.

* Which {{project_name_short}} version was downloaded and from where?
* Do other non-{{project_name_short}}-VMs such as Debian VMs have this issue?
* Did you:
** Only download, import {{project_name_short}} VM and start {{project_name_short}}?; or
** Did you start and use {{project_name_short}} then installed more software and perform other activities before the issues emerged?
* Have you previously used older versions of {{project_name_short}} that worked?
* What is the host operating system and version?
* What is the VirtualBox version?
* How much RAM does the host have?
* In case of black screen issues:
** Can you switch to a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]]? This can help with debugging.

Bugs can also be reported against upstream [https://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox]: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Bugtracker VirtualBox bugtracker] / [https://forums.virtualbox.org VirtualBox forums]. Bug reports must be well written and thorough otherwise it will not lead to a solution, see: [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=87130#p416223 bug reporting instructions].
