= Introduction =
There is no ETA (estimated time of arrival) yet.

* Downloadable images: There are no downloadable images ("ports") of {{project_name_long}} at time of writing.
* Build from source code: Testers only. [[Whonix]] is a derivative of Kicksecure. Some users are using Whonix on other architectures. (See {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/Porting#Existing_Ports_of_Whonix
|text=Existing Ports of Whonix.
}}) Therefore it is conceivable, that Kicksecure can be run on other architectures as well.
