= Introduction =

Confidential computing is an advanced security technology that protects data while it's in use, complementing existing protections for data at rest and in transit. The goal is to isolate sensitive data from unauthorized access, even from the cloud provider or system administrators.

One use case of confidential computing are virtual machines that can be trusted to remain uncompromised even in the event the cloud provider is malicious. Confidential computing is difficult because, as per the development status of most operating systems, a malicious host machine is usually able to control the environment, including all VMs in its entirety.

There are two primary things that need to be shielded against in order for confidential computing to work: compromise of the host operating system/hypervisor, and compromise of the host hardware. Three separate methods must be used in combination to defend against these threats:

* Encryption of virtual machine RAM and both physical and virtual machine disk. This is required to prevent data compromise in the event of an attacker gaining physical access to the hardware.
* Isolation of host and guest kernels. A properly configured host must '''NOT''' be able to freely inspect virtual machine RAM or inject malicious commands into virtual machines.
* Remote attestation. A user must be able to verify that the host is properly configured without having to trust the host.

The following related projects provide useful features towards confidential computing:

= Cloud Server Permission Goals =
The cloud server administrator should have the capability:

* to commission access for new customers 
* to remove access for customers (such as on non-payment)

The cloud server administrator should have the capability to:

* read hard drive or RAM contents of the customer.
* observe, manipulate software execution of the customer.

= Implementation Goals =
Ideally all software based. Not using hardware based RAM encryption and/or TPM. If that is at all possible. TODO: research

= Components =
== Full Disk Encryption Key Proetction from Cold Boot Attacks ==
=== TRESOR ===
* https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/research/system-security-group/tresor-trevisor-armored/
* Provides full disk encryption capabilities using an encryption key that is stored only within CPU registers. 
* TRESOR is actually more performant than standard AES encryption.
* When used on the host machine, it renders it impossible for a cold-boot attack to compromise disk encryption keys without being able to compromise the CPU's memory itself.
* Similar advantages are conferred on guest VMs if their CPU registers are encrypted when saved to RAM.
* Not yet present in the Linux kernel.

== RAM Encryption ==

==== Intel TME-MK ====

Total Memory Encryption - Multi-Key (TME-MK)

{{quotation
|quote=Intel has introduced Intel® Total Memory Encryption - Multi-Key (Intel® TME-MK), a new memory encryption technology, on 3rd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (formerly code named Ice Lake). 
|context=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/news/runtime-encryption-of-memory-with-intel-tme-mk.html
}}

* Provides granular, user-controllable full memory encryption. Multiple keys can be used at once, allowing a hypervisor to use one key for the host and different keys for each guest. The performance impact of using TME-MK is negligible (less than 2%).
** Allows the use of tenant-provided encryption keys, which theoretically should prevent an attacker with access to Intel from compromising the keys.
** Does not attempt to enforce guest/hypervisor isolation; the hypervisor must be trusted.
** Only supports 128-bit AES encryption. Does not support 256-bit AES encryption.
* GNOME shows status of RAM encryption: https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/12lc5l4/how_do_i_fix_the_encrypted_ram_status_in_device/

Intel TME-MK might only be available in combination with Intel vPro. However, Intel vPro comes often (or always?) packages with Intel ME and Intel AMT, which many users would rather not have inside their CPU. See [[Out-of-band Management Technology]].

==== Intel TDX ====

* https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/690419
** Provides a full suite of confidential computing technologies in one solution, including memory encryption, host/guest isolation, remote attestation, and both physical and software based attack mitigations.
** The TDX module is FOSS under the MIT license and can be built, but only builds signed by Intel can be loaded by a TDX-supporting CPU, thus it is impossible to modify the TDX module and run it yourself. One can only verify that the binaries shipped by Intel correspond to their source code.
** Confidential VMs running under TDX are known as Trust Domains (abbreviated TDs).
** Considers the VMM emulator (such as QEMU) untrusted, thus device drivers in TDs are an attack surface.
** Only allows remote attestation of the VMs, not the host machine.
** Only supports 128-bit AES encryption for memory.
** Relies on encryption keys generated by the CPU for most memory encryption tasks and for remote attestation. Thus, potentially compromisable by Intel.

==== Intel SGX ====
* Find whitepaper and link here, Intel no longer provides the SGX product brief and Archive.org was down when I went to find it there.
** Allows running limited security-sensitive code in an encrypted, remotely attestable enclave.
** Code running in enclaves is very limited in capabilities, though this can be circumvented to some degree with the help of Gramine.
** Cannot be used to encrypt an entire VM.
** Relies on encryption keys controlled by Intel, thus potentially vulnerable to an attacker with access to Intel.

=== AMD ===
==== AMD SEV technologies ====
* https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/memory-encryption-white-paper.pdf
* https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf
** Encrypts VM memory to make VMs immune to memory-based attacks.
*** Attempts to provide host/guest isolation; however, this isolation is not bulletproof as the hypervisor's device emulation is free to provide malicious data to guest device drivers (same problem mentioned in https://x86.lol/generic/2023/06/28/intel-tdx-2.html, "With TDX, the attack surface includes all device drivers... All devices are fair game from the attacker’s perspective. The malicious VMM can craft problematic responses from any device, such as the PCI Configuration Space or VirtIO."). Thus, it remains critical that the hypervisor be trusted.
*** Only supports 128-bit AES encryption.
*** Makes use of keys generated by AMD SEV firmware and does not appear to allow the hypervisor to specify the key to use. Thus, potentially compromisable by AMD.

==== AMD SME ====

* https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/memory-encryption-white-paper.pdf
** Somewhat similar to Intel TME-MK, but does not allow the use of user-provided encryption keys and appears to only use one key at a time.
*** Only supports 128-bit AES encryption.
*** Makes use of keys generated by AMD firmware and does not appear to allow the hypervisor to specify the key to use. Thus, can potentially be compromised by AMD.
* Troublesome: [https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-SME-No-Default-Use Linux To No Longer Enable AMD SME Usage By Default Due To Problems With Some Hardware]
** Better to use [[#AMD TSME]].

==== AMD TSME ====
{{quotation
|quote=Transparent SME (TSME) as the name implies is a stricter subset of SME that requires no software intervention. Under TSME, all memory pages are encrypted regardless of the C-bit value. TSME is designed for legacy OS and hypervisor software that cannot be modified. Note that when TSME is enabled, standard SME as well as SEV are still available. TSME and SME share a memory encryption key.
|context=https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/sme#Transparent_SME
}}

* https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/memory-encryption-white-paper.pdf
** Encrypts a machine's RAM contents transparently. It generates an encryption key at boot time known only to the CPU, then uses that key to encrypt anything written to RAM and decrypt anything read from RAM.
*** Available on some consumer systems (where it is branded as "Memory Guard").
*** Can be effective at stopping cold-boot attacks, thus it is recommended to enable TSME or Memory Guard if your hardware supports it.
*** TSME is not visible to the OS or applications running on the hardware, and thus does not provide any additional isolation between applications or system components.
*** Makes use of keys generated by AMD firmware and does not allow the user to specify the key to use. Thus, can potentially be compromised by AMD.

*** AMD EPYC available from root server provider <code>hetzner</code> for 236 EUR / month
**** TODO: Does this encrypt the RAM and protects it from hypothetical compromise of hetzner?

=== RamCrypt ===
* https://faui1-files.cs.fau.de/filepool/projects/ramcrypt/ramcrypt.pdf
** Provides memory encryption for individual processes running under a Linux kernel. Fully software-based, uses TRESOR for encryption of RAM. Due to being software-based, RamCrypt must store process memory in a decrypted form when that memory is being actively used. Otherwise, the software using that memory would be unable to understand the memory contents. This means that sensitive data is occasionally exposed in cleartext in system memory, though it is later re-encrypted when no longer in active use. RamCrypt therefore *mitigates* cold-boot attacks, but does not *prevent* them. RamCrypt also comes with a very substantial performance hit (at least 25%, sometimes much more).
*** It may be possible to use no-fill cache mode (a.k.a. cache-as-RAM) to mitigate RamCrypt's shortcomings in this area. It is not yet known if this is possible, and it is very likely that doing so would come with an even greater performance hit. See https://frozencache.blogspot.com/
**** PrivateCore vCage somehow manages to control CPU cache in a manner that doesn't harm performance too badly and does acheive the desired goal, so this may very well be possible. No-fill cache mode on Intel CPUs has an effect on L3 cache, so in theory if one managed the cache in a fully manual manner it could be possible to keep decrypted data present only in CPU cache.
*** Could be made to support 256-bit AES? The default implementation only supports 128-bit AES.

=== PrivateCore vCage ===
* Provides similar security to Intel TME / AMD SME, but appears to use a software implementation rather than hardware CPU features.
* Somehow keeps an entire Linux kernel and KVM hypervisor resident in L3 cache
* Company was acquired by Facebook/Meta in 2014, website appears "dead" ever since
* Technology was based on Linux and KVM, thus their source code modifications to Linux may be something that can be retrieved if it is possible to contact them?
** No source code appears to have been published
** No contact information was visible on the website
** Facebook acquired PrivateCore and it's products have never been made available to the general public.

== Kernel isolation ==
=== Use Case ===
Only needed if intending to use VMs.

In case of "root servers" / dedicated servers with only 1 customer, there is no need for for pKVM, Xen or similar.

=== pKVM ===
* https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization/architecture
* https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/
** Provides separation of host and guest operating systems on arm64 platforms (specifically Android). Uses ARM virtualization features to install a portion of the KVM hypervisor in a higher-privileged area than the rest of the kernel, thus preventing the kernel from accessing the memory of, or interfering with the execution of, VMs on the same physical device. Additionally, provides strong local and remote attestation features both within pKVM itself and with Verified Boot.
*** Guest operating systems are not assumed to be locked down, arbitrary code can be run in guests with pKVM. See https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization/security
*** Local attestation is provided by pKVM itself to prevent malicious VM tampering.
*** pKVM's security features are not guaranteed to work correctly if the device pKVM runs on is unlocked. Verified Boot can be used for remote attestation of the device to detect when this is the case (this does not use SafetyNet/Play Integrity).
*** Currently ARM64-specific; while some of the code is in the upstream Linux kernel, it is likely that some of it may be Android-specific and thus hard to use outside of the context of Android.
** KVM private memory (https://lwn.net/Articles/890224/) Isolates guest memory from a malicious KVM hypervisor.

=== Xen ===
* https://xenproject.org
* A true type-1 hypervisor. Much smaller than the Linux kernel, currently at around 370K lines of code, thus has a dramatically lower attack surface and is much easier to trust than a full Linux kernel. While a privileged virtual machine (dom0) can *control* the hypervisor, it cannot inspect VM memory. Xen also provides guest (domU) protection from dom0 to some degree (this needs to be researched further). Additionally, it provides a hardware TPM-backed vTPM implementation. Used in Qubes OS.

=== KVM private memory ===

* https://lwn.net/Articles/890224/
* Doesn't appear to be related to pKVM.

=== Gramine ===
* https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine
** Allows running unmodified Linux applications within SGX enclaves.
** Works at the application level, not the VM level.
** Cannot be used to remotely attest the host machine or the guest running the enclave, instead attempts to keep the application safe from the host and guest.
** Used by Enclaive (https://github.com/enclaive) to provide SGX-protected versions of various apps and programming languages.

== Verified Boot ==
See [[Verified Boot]].

== non-root enforcement ==
Non-root enforcement limits the privileges and access rights of non-root users or processes, ensuring they can't make system-level changes or access sensitive parts of the system without proper authorization.

Nobody, not even the cloud server administrator should have access to root (administrative rights). This is because with root rights, the cloud server administrator could get access to sensitive data on the hard drive and/or RAM contents.

related: [[Dev/boot modes]]

== Remote Attestation ==
=== What is Remote Attestation ===
* '''Purpose:''' Remote attestation is used to prove to a remote party (usually a server or another device) that the software and hardware configuration of a system is in a known and trusted state. It provides an external entity with proof that the system is running trusted software, based on cryptographic measurements (such as hashes or signatures).
* '''Process:''' A trusted platform module (TPM) or similar hardware records cryptographic measurements during the boot process. These measurements (hashes of boot components) are sent to a remote party, which compares them to a list of trusted values. If the measurements match the expected trusted state, the remote party can trust the system's integrity.
* '''Examples:'''
** In cloud computing, remote attestation is used to verify that a virtual machine (VM) or physical server is in a trusted state before allowing it to interact with sensitive data or perform specific operations.
** On Android, the operating system or application ... see [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Device_Attestation_such_as_SafetyNet|Device Attestation such as SafetyNet]].

=== Intel Trusted eXecution Technology ===
* https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025873/processors.html
* https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20paper.pdf
** Uses TPM-based features to ensure that a booted OS is trusted and uncompromised at load time.
** tboot (https://sourceforge.net/p/tboot/code/ci/default/tree/) Uses Intel TXT to securely boot Xen or Linux.

=== Raptor FlexVer ===
* https://www.raptorengineering.com/TALOS/documentation/integrimon_intro.pdf
* https://www.raptorengineering.com/TALOS/security_features.php
* https://www.crowdsupply.com/raptor-computing-systems/talos-secure-workstation/updates/talos-fpga-functions-and-responsibilities-part-2
* Present on Raptor Engineering POWER9 workstations and servers. Unclear whether there are any other systems that ship with similar technology.
** Allows one to provision a system with firmware and needed data for remote attestation on-site, then remotely attest that system's state thereafter even if transferred to a physically insecure location.
** Contains tripwires that erase sensitive data and make the machine fail attestation if tampering is detected.
** Usable to implement verified boot.
** Fully open-source with reproducible builds.
*** Source available somewhere under https://gitlab.raptorengineering.com/explore/groups most likely
** Requires a substantial investment of effort for one to gain the needed trust in a FlexVer provisioned system, as it requires one to either physically audit or trust someone else to physically audit the machine being used.

=== Trusted Platform Module remote attestation ===
* https://safeboot.dev/attestation/ provides a good overview of how this works.
* Allows a remote user to ensure they trust a machine that they will eventually run a VM on.
* Typically requires one to trust the TPM manufacturer, though Raptor FlexVer avoids this.

=== swtpm ===
* https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm
* Provides a virtual TPM for use in virtual machines. If used on a remotely attested, trusted host, allows remote attestation of individual virtual machines.
** Xen has its own vTPM subsystem which makes this unnecessary for a Xen-based deployment.

=== Keylime ===
* https://keylime.dev/
* Leverages TPM features to provide remote attestation and other security features. Investigate further.

== Miscellaneous useful technologies ==

=== Raptor LPC Guard ===
* Mitigates physical LPC bus hijacking attacks that could be used to compromise TPM-stored secrets.
** Example of such a TPM secret compromise attack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTl4vEednkQ

=== Microsoft SEAL ===
* https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal/
* General-purpose homomorphic encryption library
* Carries many warnings that it is easy to shoot yourself in the foot with
* Not directly related to confidential computing but might be useful for some part of it?

=== Constellation ===
* https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/
** Runs entire Kubernetes clusters inside confidential VMs, leveraging Intel TDX or AMD SEV along with remote attestation to keep the cluster secure
** Orchestrates a number of other components critical to confidential computing such as networking and drive encryption, key management, etc. Basically takes modern confidential computing functionality and puts it together into a single solution
** Open-source code under GNU Affero General Public License, prebuilt binaries are offered under a freemium licensing model
** Relies heavily on hardware-based confidential computing features requiring silicon vendor trust
** Depending on the cloud provider used, the cloud provider's hypervisor is considered trusted, greatly reducing security unless one can audit and remotely attest the hypervisor

=== Contrast ===
* https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/
** Runs individual Kubernetes containers inside a cluster managed and hosted by a third party.
** Orchestrates a number of other components critical to confidential computing such as networking and drive encryption, key management, etc. Basically takes modern confidential computing functionality and puts it together into a single solution
** Open-source code under GNU Affero General Public License, license of binaries is unclear
** Relies heavily on hardware-based confidential computing features requiring silicon vendor trust

=== Continuum ===
* https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/overview/confidential-kubernetes
** Runs AI code in a confidential VM, using sandboxing to make it more difficult for an AI code author to violate the privacy of the user interacting with the AI model.
** Does not use homomorphic encryption, instead relying on sandboxing to prevent the AI code from doing anything that it's not supposed to.
** Allows the user to remotely attest the confidential VMs to ensure they are trustworthy.

= Missing Pieces =
* How does one ensure that the VM they uploaded to the cloud vendor is really the one they want to run? One possible idea is to upload pre-installed, fully encrypted VMs to the cloud vendor, which can be booted only by passing an encryption key to the VM at boot time using an end-to-end encrypted channel (SSH login to initramfs). The VM then would contain sha512 hashes for every static file in it, with those hashes protected by a digital signature. On first boot, the VM would run a self-check using these hashes and signature to ensure it had not been tampered with. If this check passed, the VM would then consider itself trusted and would set itself up for vTPM-powered remote attestation. Investigate to see if a technology that performs the same functions already exists or is even needed; consider creating it if it doesn't exist and is needed.

* Does Xen support Intel TME-MK?

* Is there a way to remotely attest more than just the OS?

= Putting it all together =

* A cloud vendor uses Xen and a minimal dom0 to run cloud servers. tboot is used to ensure the hypervisor is secure.
* The cloud vendor uses TRESOR for full disk encryption, storing the encryption key on a hardware authentication device, such that in order to boot the device, a trusted staff member must insert the key into the server at boot time. (With the use of Intel TME-MK, it might theoretically be possible to implement cold-boot proof disk encryption *without* needing TRESOR; however, this requires further investigation.)
* The cloud vendor uses Intel TME-MK to encrypt the RAM of the host, preventing cold-boot attacks by a third party. At boot, the host generates an encryption key of its own and re-encrypts its memory with that new key, so as not to trust the processor-generated key used by default.
* Remote users can remotely attest the cloud vendor's physical machines at will, ensuring they trust the Xen and dom0 code running on them.
* Verified Boot and non-root enforcement attempt to mitigate tampering of the running system.
* Users upload pre-installed, encrypted VM images to the cloud vendor, which are kept tamper-proof using something (see the "missing pieces" section above). Upon passing a self-check, the VM sets itself up for remote attestation using a hypervisor-provided vTPM.
* Xen uses Intel TME-MK to encrypt the RAM of the running VM with a user-provided encryption key, preventing cold-boot attacks by either the vendor or a third party.
* Users remotely attest running VMs to ensure they are trusted.
* At this point, the user has a confidential, cold-boot-proof VM. The cloud vendor must be trusted to keep their Xen and dom0 software up-to-date so as to prevent vulnerabilities from allowing VM compromise. The cloud customer can verify remote cloud server software version numbers using remote attestation.

Rough time estimate to get TRESOR working in Linux: possibly around 80 hours of actual time invested (four hours a day, five days a week, for one month). This is a '''very''' rough estimate since actual time will depend on how receptive devs are to the ideas and how much effort is required to polish their implementation to a usable state.

= Technologies investigated but not useful =

* Microsoft Pluton: Basically a fancy hardware TPM integrated directly into the CPU. Under Linux, it only provides TPM features. It is implemented as another "secure processor" similar to Intel ME. Beyond TPM-like functionality, Pluton also provides features somewhat similar to Google's SafetyNet, but only on Windows. https://gabrielsieben.tech/2022/07/25/the-power-of-microsoft-pluton-2/
* HashiCrop 
* Azure Key Vault: Cloud-based, HSM-backed secret management system for applications. Claims to be unable to see customer-provided secrets but whether this is enforced by hardware or by policy is unclear. Not particularly useful for confidential computing.
* Google Cloud Key Management: Very similar to Azure Key Vault but from Google rather than from Microsoft.
* HashiCorp Vault: Server-based centralized application secret management system. Not directly related to confidential computing, utility in a confidential computing scenario is questionable. Would probably be useful for individuals running cloud services on confidential VMs.
* Thales cloud security: Very vague umbrella term for a number of different "security" technologies provided by Thales. Does not appear directly related to confidential computing.
* AWS Cryptographic Computing: Homomorphic encryption based technologies for processing data without decrypting it. Mostly used for machine learning purposes.
* AWS Clean Rooms: Used for allowing companies to share data analysis information with each other without exposing sensitive info directly. Unrelated to confidential computing. Appears privacy-invasive.
* Key Management Interoperability Protocol: Key management server software, conceptually similar in some ways to Hashicorp Vault. Not directly related to confidential computing, utility in a confidential computing scenario is questionable. Would probably be useful for individuals running cloud services on confidential VMs.
