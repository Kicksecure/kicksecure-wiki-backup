System is running in Secure Boot mode, however your distribution
does not provide tools for automatic generation of keys needed for
modules signing. Please consider to generate and enroll them manually:

    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/shim-signed/mok
    sudo openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -outform DER -addext "extendedKeyUsage=codeSigning" -keyout /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv -out /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
    sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
    sudo reboot

Restart "rcvboxdrv setup" after system is rebooted
.

There were problems setting up VirtualBox.  To re-start the set-up process, run
  /sbin/vboxconfig
as root.  If your system is using EFI Secure Boot you may need to sign the
kernel modules (vboxdrv, vboxnetflt, vboxnetadp, vboxpci) before you can load
them. Please see your Linux system's documentation for more information.
