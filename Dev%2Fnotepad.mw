Do not premature close this window!

- If installation fails: The log will be needed for support requests.
- If installation succeeds: You can most likely ignore this window and close it as soon as the installation has been completed.

How do I know if installation succeeded?

- If there is no error popup, installation probably succeeded.
- The same is true if the installed system is bootable.
- In case there is an error popup and the system is unbootable, installation failed.
