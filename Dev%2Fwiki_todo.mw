= General/Useful Notes =

=== use template kicksecure_wiki ===
non-ideal, please do not use:

<pre>
[https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck systemcheck]
</pre>

better:

<pre>
{{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=systemcheck
|text=systemcheck
}}
</pre>

Suitable for mass search an replace.

=== Image new format ===

Old style:

<pre>
|image=https://www.kicksecure.com/w/images/d/d6/Firefox_logo%2C_2019.svg.png
</pre>

New style:

<pre>
|image=Firefox_logo,_2019.svg.png
</pre>

Syntax for seo image changed.

Old syntax:

<pre>
{{#seo:
|description=A Crash Course in Anonymity and Security on the Internet.
|image=/URL/Documentation.jpg
}}
</pre>

New syntax:

=== Test Wiki Query Parameters (DebugJS, without JS..etc) ===
* Check this wiki chapter and test [[Dev/wiki#Custom_CSS_JavaScript_Debugging]].

=== Checking Broken Links ===

* https://ahrefs.com/broken-link-checker (requires JS)
* https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/website-dead-link-checker.asp
* https://www.drlinkcheck.com/
* https://sitechecker.pro/ (require an account for free 7 days trial)
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RottenLinks

=== Notice Only ===
Notice only. Information only. Not a task.

Keep links such as:

A)

<pre>
[https://manpages.debian.org/modesetting Debian manpages: ModeSetting]
</pre>

Do not change to:

B)

<pre>
https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/xserver-xorg-core/modesetting.4.en.html
</pre>

This is because A) is more generic. Debian already redirects to the most recent release and link. No need to use the more specific link which will break in a few years.

=== Links Knowledge ===
In https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Mobile_Phone_Security&oldid=61483&diff=cur you changed from

<pre>
https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5
</pre>

to

<pre>
https://www.businessinsider.nl/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5?international=true&r=US
</pre>

That is actually a regression. The first regression is better.

1) The part <code>?international=true&r=US</code> should not be added. (Don't add bold part. Try if it works without. If it works without, don't add it.)

https://www.businessinsider.nl/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5'''?international=true&r=US'''

2) I don't think .com was changed to .nl. It's unlikely that a primarily English news websites changes its domain from .com to .nl. Probably just some weird redirection due to Tor IP and IP detection. That link shouldn't have been changed.

=== Double Redirects to Single Redirects ===

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:DoubleRedirects

Howto:

Example bad, now:

<pre>
Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains and VPN Services -> Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies, Proxy Chains, and VPN Services -> Tor vs Proxy
</pre>

What we need to do is:

<pre>
Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains and VPN Services -> Tor vs Proxy
</pre>

Practical fix:

Go to <code>Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains</code> from Special:DoubleRedirects and press on edit and change from: 

<pre>
#REDIRECT [[Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies, Proxy Chains, and VPN Services]]
</pre>

To

<pre>
#REDIRECT [[Tor vs Proxy]]
</pre>
