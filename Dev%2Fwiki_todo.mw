=== libranet twitter import synchronization ===

https://libranet.de/profile/whonix

"Whonix 17.0.1.9 - for VirtualBox - Major Release - Debian 12 / bookworm based - Testers Wanted!"

according to nitter (dont have twitter account):

https://nitter.net/Whonix

This isnt the last post, so please sign in to libranet and try to relink the bot (or so) to twitter.

Patrick:

There is no twitter setting anymore.

Quote https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues/11157#issuecomment-1637042101

<blockquote>This is likely obsolete due to Twitter addon deprecation.</blockquote>

Please move to archived down on this wiki page so we don't forget about this.

=== Test Wiki Query Parameters (DebugJS, without JS..etc) ===
* Check this wiki chapter and test [[Dev/wiki#Custom_CSS_JavaScript_Debugging]].

=== Checking Broken Links ===

* https://ahrefs.com/broken-link-checker (requires JS)
* https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/website-dead-link-checker.asp
* https://www.drlinkcheck.com/
* https://sitechecker.pro/ (require an account for free 7 days trial)
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RottenLinks

=== Notice Only ===
Notice only. Information only. Not a task.

Keep links such as:

A)

<pre>
[https://manpages.debian.org/modesetting Debian manpages: ModeSetting]
</pre>

Do not change to:

B)

<pre>
https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/xserver-xorg-core/modesetting.4.en.html
</pre>

This is because A) is more generic. Debian already redirects to the most recent release and link. No need to use the more specific link which will break in a few years.

=== Links Knowledge ===
In https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Mobile_Phone_Security&oldid=61483&diff=cur you changed from

<pre>
https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5
</pre>

to

<pre>
https://www.businessinsider.nl/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5?international=true&r=US
</pre>

That is actually a regression. The first regression is better.

1) The part <code>?international=true&r=US</code> should not be added. (Don't add bold part. Try if it works without. If it works without, don't add it.)

https://www.businessinsider.nl/saudi-arabia-imei-track-runaways-2019-5'''?international=true&r=US'''

2) I don't think .com was changed to .nl. It's unlikely that a primarily English news websites changes its domain from .com to .nl. Probably just some weird redirection due to Tor IP and IP detection. That link shouldn't have been changed.

=== Double Redirects to Single Redirects ===

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:DoubleRedirects

Howto:

Example bad, now:

<pre>
Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains and VPN Services -> Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies, Proxy Chains, and VPN Services -> Tor vs Proxy
</pre>

What we need to do is:

<pre>
Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains and VPN Services -> Tor vs Proxy
</pre>

Practical fix:

Go to <code>Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies Proxy Chains</code> from Special:DoubleRedirects and press on edit and change from:

<pre>
#REDIRECT [[Comparison Of Tor with CGI Proxies, Proxy Chains, and VPN Services]]
</pre>

To

<pre>
#REDIRECT [[Tor vs Proxy]]
</pre>

=== How to add images to mininav ===

=== Grammar fixing tools ===
* Grammarly:

Unsupported, only support posts (like twitter or facebook or email..) not for/when editing a page or so (yet).

Ticket: https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/6647856

ChatGPT:

Doesnt work with long wikis/paragraphs, only small portions of text needed to be posted at a time to correct it properly (not useful for pages grammar correction).

= Wiki Usability Review =

== Risks of Omitting Backups ==
What are the risks if I don’t back up my data before installing Kicksecure? Also, what’s the best way for someone new to this to back up their data?

== Partitioning ==
What are the steps, especially what I need to think about when partitioning my system? (using calamares)

== Root Permissions ==
Understanding the implications of root permissions and user account configurations is a little complex. (Is there a better way to grasp it)?

= Backlog =
== Test and Improve Whonix Installer Download Documentation ==
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Quick_Start_Testers_Only_Version

* test
* update screenshots
* document windows smartfilter warning, add screenshots
