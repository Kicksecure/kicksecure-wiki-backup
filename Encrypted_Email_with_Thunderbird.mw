'''1. Create an Address Book for Spam'''

* If you haven't already, create an address book named "Spam" in Thunderbird.
* Add the email addresses of the senders you want to filter out.

'''2. Create a Folder for Spam'''

* If you haven't already, create a new folder named "Spam" or any other name you prefer.

'''3. Set Up a Message Filter'''

# Go to '''Tools''' > '''Message Filters'''.
# Click '''New''' to create a new filter.
# Name your filter, e.g., "Move to Spam Folder".
# Under the section '''For incoming messages that:''', choose '''Match any of the following'''.
# Add a condition: '''From''' '''is in my address book''' '''Spam'''.
# Under the section '''Perform these actions:''', select '''Move Message to''' and then choose the "Spam" folder you created earlier.
# Click '''OK''' to save the filter.

'''4. Test the Filter'''

* Send a test email from one of the addresses in the "Spam" address book to see if it gets moved to the "Spam" folder automatically.

'''Note:''' Ensure you check the Spam folder occasionally to ensure no legitimate emails are being incorrectly filtered. Adjust the filter or address book as necessary.
