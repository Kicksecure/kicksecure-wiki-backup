= Relationship between {{Kicksecure}} and {{Whonix}} =
{{Kicksecure}} is an operating system designed with a focus on security by default.

{{Whonix}}, on the other hand, prioritizes both anonymity and security by default.

Despite {{Whonix}} being the predecessor, {{Kicksecure}} was established by the same individual who founded {{Whonix}}.

Chronologically, {{Whonix}} was introduced before {{Kicksecure}}. However, in terms of the software stack, {{Whonix}} builds upon the foundation of {{Kicksecure}}. It is technically "based on" {{Kicksecure}}, not vice versa.

The phrase "based on" is used here to describe the technical framework rather than the historical timeline. Since {{Kicksecure}}'s core focus is security, it serves as a more streamlined base to which additional features (such as anonymity) can be added. This modular approach ensures that {{Kicksecure}} maintains a clean and secure baseline, which can be expanded upon by {{Whonix}} to integrate further privacy features.

Conceptually, {{Kicksecure}} was engineered as an independent project with no technical dependencies on {{Whonix}}. This design philosophy allows for a conceptual understanding where {{Kicksecure}} could be seen as the foundational layer, with {{Whonix}} acting as an extension or "add-on" that incorporates anonymity features on top of {{Kicksecure}}'s secure base.
