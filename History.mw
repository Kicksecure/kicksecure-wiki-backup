= Brief {{project_name_short}} History =
{{project_name_short}} in its first iteration was called {{Code|Hardened Debian}}. It was later renamed to {{code|{{project_name_short}}}}.

11 January 2012: [https://www.whonix.org {{Whonix}} (anonymity and security focused operating system)] (at that time still called TorBOX) has been founded.

15 September 2018: [https://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/hardened-debian-in-development-feedback-wanted.408245/ Initial announcement of {{project_name_short}}] (By then still called {{Code|Hardened Debian}}.) <ref>
Or even earlier?
</ref> {{project_name_short}} was founded by the same founder as {{Whonix}}, which has an nine year [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/History history] of protecting users from [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Security_in_Real_World real world de-anonymization attacks].

= Relationship between {{Kicksecure}} and {{Whonix}} =
{{Kicksecure}} is a security by default operating system.

{{Whonix}} is an anonymity and security by default operating system.

{{Kicksecure}} was founded by the same founder as {{Whonix}}.

{{Whonix}} was released first. {{Kicksecure}} was released later.

{{Whonix}} is based on {{Kicksecure}}. Not the other way around.

The terminology "based on" is referring to the technical implementation and not chronological historical events. Since {{Kicksecure}} is only focusing on security, it is better to add extra features (anonymity) as software packages on top. If {{Kicksecure}} was based on {{Whonix}} then the technical implementation would be inferior because {{Kicksecure}} would have to remove software packages which would be a lot more confusing.

{{Kicksecure}} was and is being designed as a standalone project that has no technical dependency on {{Whonix}}. The relationship between {{Kicksecure}} and {{Whonix}} is intended to make sense as if {{Kicksecure}} was developed first and {{Whonix}} later as an "add-on".
