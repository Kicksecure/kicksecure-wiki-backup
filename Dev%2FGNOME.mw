= Reasons Against Using a Minimal Desktop Environment Without Its Bad Stuff =

While it might be theoretically possible to avoid GNOME's undesirable aspects by selectively using only core packages like the window manager and systray, this approach is not without significant drawbacks.

Selectively using GNOME components, such as the window manager and systray, and concurrently issuing warnings about other standard GNOME functionalities, presents a contradiction and practical challenges. This methodology seems counterintuitive: utilizing only specific parts of GNOME (like the window manager and systray) while also having to add warnings and disclaimers against its standard, documented features in user documentation and support requests.

For example, GNOME's recommended method for installing the Clipboard Indicator involves visiting [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/ extensions.gnome.org Clipboard Indicator] and clicking 'Install'. However, this raises a question: what is the secure alternative that bypasses browser interactions and includes digital software verification? As of this writing, this remains unclear.

For instance, consider a user query:

{{quotation
|quote=Is it safe to install [https://packages.debian.org/gnome-clocks gnome-clocks]?"
|context=Hypothetical user support request.
}}

{{quotation
|quote=No, it is not recommended due to its dependency on [https://packages.debian.org/gnome-clocks geoclue-2.0]. This dependency not only expands the attack surface but also has [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/issues/177 privacy concerns]. Currently, instructions to mitigate these risks remain [[undocumented]]."
|context=Hypothetical reply.
}}

Such an approach would lead to inconsistency and confusion for users, undermining the practicality of using a minimal GNOME setup.

No comparable issues exist for Xfce. Users have the advantage of leveraging both Debian and Xfce documentation, along with resources from third parties, to customize and utilize Xfce effectively.

= Usability =

'''Systray Absence:''' By default, GNOME does not include a systray.

How can it be added?

* For typical GNOME users, the recommended method is to visit: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/ AppIndicator Support] and click the 'Install' button.
* Command line: For users who want to install from the command line, packages.debian.org or from source code while performing digital software signatures verification: Unknown.
* Linux distributions: For Linux distributions using a build script, the process remains unclear. ([[Dev/Derivative-Maker#Introduction|Clicking buttons is inappropriate for Linux distribution build scripts.]]) Should a solution for command line become available, it might also provide insight into this scenario.
