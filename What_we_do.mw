* [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/genmkfile genmkfile] - easy and turbo packaging of scripts and configuration files.
* Demonstrating how to write hassle free manual ("<code>man</code>") pages.
** For example, the following methodology is used for all related {{project_name_short}} packages.
** Written in markdown.
** Just three lines of packaging is required. <ref>

== Education ==

{{project_name_short}} undertakes a broad range of educational activities, including:
* Extensive [[Documentation]] covering technical aspects and operational security.
** Security matter are documented in detail, including unique material not covered elsewhere.
** Technical documentation is also provided, for example: [[Configuration_Files|Configuration Files]].
* {{project_name_short}} answers are seldom disputed; for example see [https://tor.stackexchange.com/users/80/adrelanos?tab=answers answers by Patrick Schleizer] on [https://tor.stackexchange.com/ Tor Stack Exchange].
* Operating a responsive [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}} forum], providing user support for the community.
* Debian derivative development documentation, for example: [[Dev/About_Debian_Packaging|About Debian Packaging]]

== Maintenance ==
{{IconSet|h1|1}} Maintenance Work (illustrative not exhaustive):

{{IconSet|h1|2}} '''Architecture and long-term design decisions'''
* Choosing what belongs in “core hardening” versus what becomes optional (maintainability constraints are explicitly a design focus).
* Deciding when to avoid custom solutions (for example, custom hardened kernel scope risk and long-term maintenance tradeoffs).

{{IconSet|h1|3}} '''Backlog triage and support load management'''
* Reading and categorizing reports: bug versus support request versus duplicate versus out-of-scope.
* Keeping a backlog of known issues and feature requests while balancing limited developer time.
* Writing and maintaining policy pages and linking them as needed (for example [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] and [[Reporting_Bugs#Policy_Rationale|Policy Rationale]]).

{{IconSet|h1|4}} '''Codebase maintenance across many repositories'''
* Maintaining many source repositories, shared tooling, helper scripts, and common libraries.
* Reviewing, merging, and maintaining contributions while keeping behavior consistent across components.

{{IconSet|h1|5}} '''Debian packaging work'''
* Creating and maintaining Debian packages, including packaging metadata, dependencies, and compatibility across Debian changes.
* Handling transitions and regressions caused by upstream changes (toolchain, dependencies, defaults).

{{IconSet|h1|6}} '''APT repository operations and signing'''
* APT repository updated. 
* Managing signing keys, signing automation, and key rollover procedures.
* Keeping repository configuration guidance and documentation current.

{{IconSet|h1|7}} '''Image build system engineering'''
* Maintaining the ISO and image build pipeline and build documentation.
* Rebuilding and re-validating images when dependencies change.
* Artifact integrity work: hash sums, signatures, and verification instructions.

{{IconSet|h1|8}} '''Release engineering and QA'''
* Coordinating releases, changelogs, release notes, and announcements.
* Regression triage before and after releases.
* Maintaining a test matrix across environments (for example BIOS, UEFI, Secure Boot, and virtual machines).

{{IconSet|h1|9}} '''Installer and desktop integration'''
* Maintaining installer integration and live image behavior.
* Handling desktop integration changes that can impact usability and support load.

{{IconSet|h1|10}} '''Secure Boot and kernel-module edge cases'''
* Handling Secure Boot workflows, MOK enrollment, and troubleshooting.
* DKMS module signing and related failure modes.

{{IconSet|h1|11}} '''Documentation upkeep'''
* Keeping documentation synchronized with code, packages, defaults, and releases.
* Maintaining troubleshooting guidance to reduce repeated support load.

{{IconSet|h1|12}} '''Support tooling and guardrails'''
* Maintaining diagnostic and maintenance tooling that enables self-support.
* Improving user-facing guidance that reduces repeated, time-consuming support threads.

{{IconSet|h1|13}} '''Security hardening maintenance'''
* Maintaining hardening defaults and security-related packages.
* Re-evaluating hardening behavior when upstream changes interact with security assumptions.

{{IconSet|h1|14}} '''Upgrades and migration paths'''
* Minimizing upgrade breakage and documenting upgrade caveats.
* Responding to upstream changes that impact upgrade safety and user workflows.

{{IconSet|h1|15}} '''Coordination with upstream projects'''
* Tracking upstream changes (Debian and other dependencies), reporting issues upstream, and integrating fixes.
* Maintaining temporary workarounds where necessary until upstream resolves issues.

{{IconSet|h1|16}} '''CI and testing automation'''
* Maintaining and improving build automation, test automation, and reproducibility where feasible.
* Compensating for gaps in automation with manual testing and community testing calls.

{{IconSet|h1|17}} '''Infrastructure operations'''
* Keeping project services secure and operational (website, wiki, forums, issue tracker).
* Backups, monitoring, capacity planning, and operational security.

{{IconSet|h1|18}} '''Communications and user guidance'''
* Maintaining "important news" style communications: vulnerabilities, upgrade issues, common issues, and improved releases.
* Writing clear, actionable guidance that prevents repeat support load.

{{IconSet|h1|19}} '''Research and incident response readiness'''
* Following security developments and translating findings into mitigations, documentation, and/or code.
* Being ready to react quickly to time-sensitive security issues.

{{IconSet|h1|20}} '''Sustainability constraints'''
* Balancing limited developer time against a large backlog and ongoing maintenance needs.
* Making maintainability decisions to avoid creating future support and maintenance debt.
