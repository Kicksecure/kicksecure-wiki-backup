= {{project_name_short}} Default Browser Considerations =
== Introduction ==
[[Kicksecure]] is primarily a security-focused Linux distribution. When a choice must be made between improving security or privacy, security is prioritized. However, {{project_name_short}} will never include features that compromise privacy, such as tracking users or collecting telemetry data without their explicit consent. In fact, {{project_name_short}} offers slightly better privacy than most Linux distributions. For example, it does not include tools like the "popularity contest" package, which reports usage statistics.

That said, {{project_name_short}} does not aim to match the strong privacy protections provided by [[Whonix]]. Even so, {{project_name_short}} is still a suitable host system for running {{project_name_long}} -- at least until the dedicated {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Whonix-Host
|text=Whonix-Host
}} becomes available. This is not a contradiction, since {{project_name_long}} can run effectively on any secure Linux distribution that avoids privacy-compromising practices. See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

For some, considerations such as [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Beyond_Licensing|concerns about user autonomy related to browser market dominance]] and [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_reduced_capabilities_to_plugin_with_adblocker|reduced capabilities to plugin with adblocker]] might play a role.

Choosing a default browser in {{project_name_short}} is therefore a complex decision.

Firefox is currently installed by default until [[Dev/browser-choice]] has been implemented due to the issue of [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Selling_User_Data|Firefox selling user data]].

This decision is guided by what is achievable within current development resources and priorities. Developing a secure Linux distribution is already a substantial task. {{project_name_short}} is not attempting to solve every broad or systemic issue, such as the many [[Miscellaneous Threats to User Freedom]], from the very beginning.

See also [[#Potential Future Solutions]] for options that might be explored later in the project's development.

== Overview of Browser Hardening Approaches ==

* '''Settings projects:''' These are tools or files that try to improve security and privacy by tweaking thousands of browser settings. But mainstream browsers like Firefox and Chromium have so many settings — some of which change over time, get ignored, or are reversed by the browser itself — that trying to get and keep all these settings right is probably a losing battle. This is why it may be seen as a "mission impossible."

* '''Soft forks:''' This means taking an existing browser like Firefox or Chromium and making only small changes, then continuing to update the fork with new changes from the original browser. The problem is, these browsers are so huge and complex that even small changes can break things. Also, keeping up with changes in the original project — called '''re-basing''' — can become very difficult and time-consuming. For more technical background, see:
** [[Dev/About_Computer_(In)Security#Too_Much_Source_Code|Too Much Source Code]]
** [[Dev/About_Computer_(In)Security#Too_Much_Complexity|Too Much Complexity]]
** [[Dev/Default_Browser#Difficulty_to_Create_a_Browser|Difficulty to Create a Browser]]

* '''Hard forks:''' These are more extreme. A '''hard fork''' means copying the entire browser and making major changes — often enough that it becomes difficult or impossible to merge in changes from the original browser later on. This can be better for removing unwanted parts of the software ("anti-features"), but it's much more expensive in terms of developer time. A project would need to be large and well-funded to do this correctly and securely.

* '''Independent browsers not based on Chromium or Firefox:''' These are built from scratch or from a completely different codebase. This is probably the best long-term option, since it avoids inheriting unwanted problems from Firefox or Chromium. But it's very rare, because building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult and resource-intensive.

== Criteria ==

* <u>Security-first approach:</u> The top priority for Kicksecure is '''security'''. This means choosing options that reduce the risk of attacks, even if that means making reasonable trade-offs with other features like convenience or privacy enhancements.
** <u>Reasonable?</u> See [[Stable_Version_User_Experience|Kicksecure Stable Version User Experience]].
* <u>Anti-fingerprinting is secondary:</u> Making every browser look the same (to avoid being tracked by its "fingerprint") is useful, but comes after baseline security. It helps prevent websites from identifying users based on subtle technical differences in how their browser behaves.
** <u>Kicksecure Privacy:</u> See [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].
* <u>Disabled telemetry:</u> This stops the browser from sending data back to its developers. It enhances both:
** <u>Security:</u> because it reduces the browser's '''attack surface''' (the parts of the software that an attacker could potentially exploit).
** <u>Privacy:</u> because it stops unsolicited data leaks.
* <u>Radio Silence:</u> The browser should not silently connect to the internet by itself (such as checking for updates or showing sponsored content). This is important for users to remain in control and prevent unwanted background communication. See [https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues/1779 LibreWolf's Radio Silence request].
* <u>Clean source code:</u> If using a fork of an existing browser, any '''anti-features''' (like adware, trackers, or DRM modules) must be removed from the source code entirely — not just disabled in settings. Otherwise, there’s a risk they could be re-enabled by accident or after an update.
** <u>DRM:</u> If DRM is needed at all, it should be a browser plugin and packaged separately.
* <u>No hardcoded connections:</u> The browser’s source code should not include specific IP addresses or domain names. These can force the browser to "phone home" (connect to developer servers) in ways the user may not expect or control.
* <u>Long-term maintainability:</u> The browser project should be active and well-funded (or backed by a strong community), with regular security updates. If it’s abandoned or poorly maintained, users could be left vulnerable to known exploits. Also, switching browsers is hard for some users — so the default browser must be a stable choice for years.
* <u>Vendor neutrality:</u>
** <u>Definition:</u> The principle of avoiding favoritism or affiliation with any specific commercial provider within a software project, platform, or service. A vendor-neutral approach ensures that no particular company’s branding, products, or services are endorsed, promoted, or required by default.
** <u>Advantages:</u> This enhances user freedom and avoids perceived or actual conflicts of interest. Maintaining vendor neutrality is important for preserving trust, promoting long-term sustainability, and ensuring that technology choices remain open, interchangeable, and not dependent on specific proprietary ecosystems.
** <u>Generic description:</u> A vendor-neutral project does not include pre-configured integrations with a specific company's infrastructure, use company-branded names or logos in its user interface, or redirect users to company-hosted web services. Instead, it is developed and maintained independently or by a community, with the goal of serving users without implicit or explicit commercial bias.
** <u>Example of a vendor-neutral project:</u> GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a vendor-neutral software project. It is developed by a community of contributors and does not promote or depend on any specific commercial provider. The application does not include proprietary branding, cloud integrations, or advertisements for paid services. Users can download, use, and modify GIMP without being directed toward a company or locked into a commercial ecosystem. This neutrality supports user freedom, trust, and long-term sustainability.
** <u>Specific examples of vendor affiliations:</u>
*** <u>The opposite of vendor neutrality:</u>
**** Advertising companies.
**** VPN companies.
* <u>No DNS settings changes:</u> DNS settings should be configured at the operating system level for all applications and traffic. Not at the browser level.
* <u>Follow UNIX philosophy:</u>
** DOTADIW: Do One Thing And Do It Well
** POLA: Principle of least astonishment

== Installation Source ==
=== Flatpak ===
In some cases, [[Install_Software#Flatpak|Flatpak]] might be unsuitable. See [[Install_Software#Flatpak_Breaking_the_Native_Sandbox_of_Applications|Flatpak Breaking the Native Sandbox of Applications]].

== Disregarded Solutions ==

=== No browser installed by default ===

Due to [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Selling_User_Data|Firefox Selling User Data]] the following has been recinded.

<s>That would result in a terrible user experience, especially for Live ISO / USB users, who would have to wait until all browser-related packages are downloaded and installed using APT. Users want a ready-to-go solution. The fact that they already have to invest time in getting a new operating system is already a barrier. Asking them to wait until a browser downloads is too much.</s>

In other words, no browser installed by default and [[Dev/browser-choice]] is the development plan.

=== Install both firefox-esr and chromium by default ===

* A waste of disk space.
* Longer update times, as both packages would need to be downloaded in the future.
* Does not take a strong stance against Chromium.

== Potential Future Solutions ==
Might be implemented in a later version but not in the initial versions.

=== Browser Choice Dialog ===

Similar to this:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/BrowserChoice.gif

See [[Dev/browser-choice]].

=== Cache Browser Installation Files ===
During the build process of {{project_name_short}}, download (cache) both packages, firefox-esr and chromium, but do not install them. This is to avoid APT traffic and time wasted on network downloads. In more technical terms, similar to this:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --download-only firefox-esr
sudo apt install --download-only chromium
</pre>

The packages will then be cached but not actually installed. These downloaded package files will reside in the folder <code>/var/cache/apt/archives</code> and otherwise do nothing. They would be cleaned up once the user runs <code>sudo apt clean</code>.

This approach would work well for an ISO release but not for installation from a repository. The latter may not be a long-term priority and perhaps only relevant for servers (server vendors will not offer {{project_name_short}} pre-installed anytime soon), but then, servers do not require a browser.

It is not yet certain if this can work with the ISO build process.

Additionally, there is a technical issue after the first boot. Suppose users run <code>sudo apt update</code> followed by <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code> before ever starting a browser, which is recommended and good security practice. Then, when running the browser choice dialog (by clicking the browser icon in the start menu)...

At this point, the browser choice tool will likely be unable to run <code>sudo apt install firefox-esr</code> or <code>sudo apt install chromium</code> on behalf of the user without network traffic. This is because dependencies and package versions may have changed in the meantime. (Users who ran <code>sudo apt update</code> would have noticed this.) This decreases usability. Thus, the browser choice tool would change from <code>offline install of a previously downloaded browser package</code> to a <code>network-dependent download and install of the browser</code>.

To keep the browser choice tool as an <code>offline install of a previously downloaded browser package</code>, should the browser choice prompt appear as a popup at first boot?

There may be technical solutions for all of this, but making the default browser choice a seamless experience would be a major development task.

= About the Debian specific patches =

Mozilla recognizes that patches applied to Iceweasel/Firefox don't
impact the quality of the product.
Patches which should be reported upstream to improve the product always
have been forward upstream by the Debian packagers. Mozilla agrees about
specific patches to facilitate the support of Iceweasel on architecture
supported by Debian or Debian-specific patches.

More generally, Mozilla trusts the Debian packagers to use their best
judgment to achieve the same quality as the official Firefox binaries.

In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.
Ubuntu having a different packaging, this does not apply to that distribution.

Opinion by a non-lawyer:

The phrasing <code>can be used as long as the patches applied are in the same category as described above</code> could be interpreted as in a patch which disables all telemetry, tracking and phone-home as much as possible would be in a different category and hence might in the viewpoint of Mozilla violate their trademark.

subject:

<pre>
Kicksecure Default Browser Configuration Trademark Question
</pre>

body:

<pre>
I am the lead developer of the Kicksecure project, a Linux distribution focused on security and based on Debian. Kicksecure is developed by the same team as Whonix, which is somewhat more well-known.

Our hardened defaults extend to the default user applications on the system, including a daily drivable web browser.

We are currently in the process of reviewing and considering potential candidates to be the default web browser on Kicksecure.

With good intentions, various Kicksecure contributors have suggested shipping Mozilla Firefox as the default browser. However, some contributors, including myself, are concerned about the modifications to Firefox's default settings we intend to make, versus Mozilla's Trademark Policy. We have no intention of rebranding or changing the compilation options of Firefox binaries. In fact, we prefer to keep the Mozilla trademarked names for the products to provide our users with a sense of familiarity.

We would acquire unaltered binaries from one of the following sources:

- Debian's official packages.debian.org repository
- Mozilla's official packages.mozilla.org repository
- Mozilla's official Firefox Flathub repository

Ideally, we would use Mozilla sources.

Here is a trademark-respecting list of things we are aware of and want to avoid for understandable reasons:

* Not using Mozilla trademarks in the name of our business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
* Not using marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to Mozilla trademarks.
* Not using Mozilla trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Mozilla of our products or services.
* Not displaying Mozilla trademarks more prominently than our product, service, or company name.
* Not using Mozilla trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)
* Not using Mozilla trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g., offering technical support services), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g., “Independent technical support for Mozilla’s Firefox browser”).
* Not modifying Mozilla’s trademarks, abbreviating them, or combining them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporating them into a tagline or slogan.

And here is a list of things that we would like to do. Our primary intention is to have a default policy (or employ other means if more appropriate) to do the following:

* Use unaltered binaries.
* Disable all Telemetry, Studies, Reports, and non-essential implicit outgoing connections.
* Force install the addon "uBlock Origin" by Raymond Hill.
* Set and lock hardened SSL/TLS-related settings, including, but not limited to, setting HTTPS-only mode as the default, blocking mixed content, not trusting unsafe negotiations, disabling unencrypted background requests, etc.
* Disable sponsored components, like bookmarks and suggestions.
* Set and lock strict mode for ETP.
* Change the default homepage.
* Disable the default display of the "Know Your Rights" information page.

As an illustrative point of how specifically we plan to apply these changes:

- Our intended changes would be made by providing a separate package (for example, named "hardened-browser-config").
- This package would install config file(s) in folder(s) such as /etc/firefox or /etc/firefox-esr.
- The package would be installed by default.

We are willing to elaborate on the details and consider making modifications upon request by Mozilla.

We are not asking for any special permission that does not extend to derivatives. As stated on the Debian issue tracker:

> In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
> as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.

This is related to the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) (item 8):

> License must not be specific to Debian
>
> The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the Debian system.

We would like to be able to state similarly:

> In case of derivatives of Kicksecure, Firefox branding can be used as long as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.

We are asking for your opinion on whether this would be in conflict with Mozilla's Trademark Policy.

We intend to publish our correspondence for the sake of transparency. Our communications and your responses will be publicized in full, verbatim, without modifications.
</pre>

==== 06 March 2024 ====

Patrick,

Thanks for your email.

Unfortunately the changes you would like to make do not comply with our
distribution policy
<https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/distribution-policy/>,
including the following:

You may not add to, remove, or change any part of the software, including
the Mozilla trademarks themselves. For example, you may not add any
extensions to Firefox, change default settings, or alter search codes.

If you would like to distribute Firefox unmodified, you can use our .deb.

You can, of course, make any modifications you wish to Firefox’s open
source software if you distribute a browser without Mozilla and Firefox
trademarks. Based on your requirements, the Tor Browser might also be an
option you could consider.

Patrick,

Thanks for your email.

Unfortunately the changes you would like to make do not comply with our
distribution policy
<https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/distribution-policy/>,
including the following:

You may not add to, remove, or change any part of the software, including
the Mozilla trademarks themselves. For example, you may not add any
extensions to Firefox, change default settings, or alter search codes.

If you would like to distribute Firefox unmodified, you can use our .deb.

You can, of course, make any modifications you wish to Firefox=E2=80=99s op=
en
source software if you distribute a browser without Mozilla and Firefox
trademarks. Based on your requirements, the Tor Browser might also be an
option you could consider.

Mike Kaply

=== Firefox Potential Legal Risk - Workaround ===
Opinion by a non-lawyer:

If there was an opt-in package that users can choose to install, this might not violate Mozilla's trademark. This is because this solution would be similar to a user visiting the [[Dev/Default_Browser#arkenfox|arkenfox]] project website and manually installing a settings file in <code>/etc/firefox</code> or <code>/etc/firefox-esr</code> folder. This solution might be good enough for Kicksecure.

== Brave Browser ==

* <u>Built-in ad blocker:</u> Brave includes an advertisement blocker by default, which helps reduce tracking and speeds up web browsing.
* <u>Ad-funded business model:</u> Despite blocking ads, Brave is itself an advertising company. It replaces traditional ads with its own ad system.
** [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)#Business_model Brave Business Model on Wikipedia]
* <u>Market stance:</u> Using Brave is seen by some as a stand against the dominance of Firefox and Chrome — although using any alternative browser could also be interpreted this way.
* <u>Controversies:</u> Brave has faced criticism for certain business decisions and privacy concerns.

== LibreWolf ==
=== LibreWolf - Lack of Radio Silence as a Development Goal ===
LibreWolf inherits many of the same phone home features from Firefox. At the time of writing, LibreWolf feature request [https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues/1779 Radio Silence by Default for Browser Startup and Background Connections aka "Disable Phone Home" #1779] has not been acknowledged by LibreWolf developers as a development goal.

=== LibreWolf - IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up) Feature Removal ===
LibreFox, from which LibreWolf was forked, also had a IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up) feature.

{{quotation
|quote=This is a set of settings that aim to remove all the server links embedded in Firefox and other calling home functions in the purpose of blocking un-needed connections. The objective is zero unauthorized connection (ping/telemetry/Mozilla/Google...).
|context=LibreFox, [https://github.com/intika/Librefox/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#ijwy-i-just-want-you-to-shut-up IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up)] feature
}}

Last mention of IJWY in LibreWolf's settings file has been removed in this git diff.

=== LibreWolf - Updates ===
LibreWolf lags behind Firefox a few days up to 1 week.

{{quotation
|quote=Regarding Librewolf’s slow updates, I think this issue has been very greatly exaggerated, having used it as one of my browsers for almost over 30 months, I personally do not recall it ever really being more than one week behind Firefox, usually it is only a couple working days at worst.
|context={{Github_link|repo=security-misc|path=/issues/192#issuecomment-1910407278}}
}}

=== LibreWolf - Bugs ===
Bugs reported to only be reproducible in LibreWolf but not in Firefox:

* https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues/1769

Bugs maybe specific to LibreWolf only but not Firefox:

* https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues/1774

== LibreFox ==
https://github.com/intika/Librefox is dead as per https://github.com/intika/Librefox/issues/141

[[#LibreWolf|LibreWolf]] (https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/) is active.

LibreFox had a potential legal issue with Mozilla:

* https://github.com/intika/Librefox/commit/45a4d3ce647b8c896e81ce3e5ac5ddc95ff045e0 mentions legal issues.
* Question about it: https://github.com/intika/Librefox/issues/125#issuecomment-1913347606

[https://github.com/intika intika], the developer of Librefox disappeared. The website [https://linuxhacks.org/ linuxhacks.org] is still online so one could assume that someone is still paying the bills. Still active on [https://stackexchange.com/users/3950473/intika?tab=activity StackExchange].

== Mullvad Browser ==

'''Upstream Documentation:'''

* https://mullvad.net/en/browser
* https://mullvad.net/en/browser/hard-facts

'''{{project_name_short}} user documentation:'''

* <u>Opt-in Installation:</u> Users can easily choose to install [[Mullvad Browser]] (MB). It is not installed by default but available for installation.

'''Advantages:'''

* <u>Anti-browser fingerprinting:</u> Helps protect user privacy by making it harder for websites to create a unique identifier (called a “fingerprint”) based on a browser’s settings and behavior. This reduces tracking even without cookies.
* <u>Company stability:</u> Mullvad is a long-standing and well-known VPN provider. Because the organization is established and reputable, its browser software is less likely to be discontinued unexpectedly.
* <u>VPN support:</u> Mullvad Browser is compatible with virtual private networks (VPNs), including Mullvad VPN. However, the browser does not rely on a VPN to function and does not activate one automatically.
* <u>Security features:</u> Includes a "security level slider", that allows users to choose between different levels of protection. Higher levels can disable certain browser features (like JavaScript) to reduce attack surface, at the cost of website compatibility.
* <u>Installation:</u> [https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux Debian package repository available.] This means users on Debian-based systems, including {{project_name_short}}, can install and update Mullvad Browser more easily using standard package management tools like <code>apt</code>. It simplifies maintenance and ensures users receive updates automatically.
* <u>Software compatibility:</u> Fully supported by tools like <code>tb-updater</code> and <code>tb-starter</code>, which are part of {{project_name_short}}. These tools help users install and launch privacy-focused browsers easily.

'''Disadvantages:'''

* <u>Vendor branding:</u> Mullvad Browser includes visual elements and default configurations that are closely tied to the Mullvad company and its VPN service. This makes it not "vendor-neutral"—it is clearly associated with and promoting a specific commercial provider.
** <u>Vendor neutral example:</u> To explain what is meant by vendor-neutrality, consider an example like GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). GIMP is developed and maintained by a dedicated team, but it does not promote a particular company, paid service, or infrastructure. When users install GIMP, they are not presented with branding for a cloud provider, upsell to a premium version, or integration with a specific company’s services.
** <u>Why Mullvad Browser is not vendor neutral?</u> Mullvad Browser, by contrast, includes the Mullvad name in its title, uses Mullvad’s DNS servers by default, and sets its homepage and extensions to promote the Mullvad VPN.
** <u>Home page and extensions:</u> The browser comes with a default home page and browser extension designed by Mullvad.
*** <blockquote>MULLVAD BROWSER</blockquote>
*** <blockquote>Developed in collaboration between the Tor Project and Mullvad VPN</blockquote>
*** <code>Disable Mullvad DoH (encrypted DNS)</code>: a setting to disable Mullvad’s default DNS-over-HTTPS service.

* <u>Purpose of browser:</u>
** <u>Opinion:</u> These points are interpretive and based on perspective.
*** A) <u>For Mullvad users:</u> The browser seems designed primarily to complement and enhance Mullvad's VPN service.
*** B) <u>As advertising:</u> The browser can also be viewed as a way to promote Mullvad and differentiate it from other VPN providers.
*** C) <u>For all users (even non-customers):</u> It still provides strong privacy and security features regardless of whether the user subscribes to Mullvad VPN.

* <u>VPN confusion:</u> Because of its branding, some users may wrongly assume that the browser automatically connects to Mullvad VPN. It does not. This misunderstanding is addressed in the [[Mullvad_Browser#Mullvad_VPN|Mullvad VPN]] section of the documentation.

* <u>Browser basis:</u> Mullvad Browser is built on Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release), which prioritizes stability over having the newest features. It does not include the latest Firefox updates immediately. Firefox ESR might be less secure than Firefox Rapid Release, see [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Security_-_ESR_.28Extended_Support_Release.29_versus_Rapid_Release|Firefox Security - ESR (Extended Support Release) versus Rapid Release]].

* <u>DNS configuration:</u>
** <u>Default behavior:</u> By default, Mullvad Browser uses DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and sends all DNS queries through Mullvad’s own DNS servers. This means DNS traffic is encrypted, but also centralized.
** <u>Privacy implications:</u> DNS queries (which convert website names like example.com into IP addresses) do not use the DNS server set by the user or their network (like a home router). Instead, they go to Mullvad’s server, giving Mullvad insight into the websites being accessed.
** <u>Violation of separation of power:</u> Some might consider this design problematic because it combines software creation and infrastructure control. For example, the Tor Project develops the Tor software, but independent volunteers run the relays. By comparison, it could be argued that browser developers should not also run core infrastructure like DNS servers.
** <u>Inconsistency with system settings:</u> The browser uses its own DNS settings, which may differ from the rest of the system. This could confuse users or system administrators.
** <u>Usability issue:</u> Breaks the "Principle of Least Astonishment" (POLA). Users typically expect the browser to follow the system’s DNS settings, not override them.
** <u>Increased complexity:</u> If someone changes the system DNS settings (for more privacy or security), it won’t affect Mullvad Browser unless the change is made there separately. This makes DNS management harder.
** <u>See also:</u> [[DNS Security]] and this forum thread: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 Use DNSCrypt by default in Kicksecure? (not Whonix)]

* <u>Usability:</u>
** <u>No stored logins:</u> Mullvad Browser does not keep cookies after closing. This means websites will not remember the user, and users have to log in again each time they open the browser.
** <u>No built-in password manager:</u> The browser does not have a feature to save passwords. Users must type in their login details every time they visit a site. <ref>

* <u>Summary:</u> No. This is a [[Declined|declined feature request]]. Details? See below.

** <u>Community project vs corporate project:</u> MB is developed by a VPN company and not a community project solely focusing on maintaining an independent web browser.
** <u>Omnipresent VPN company advertisements:</u> Many or even most podcasts, popular YouTube channels, and so forth contain advertisements for VPN companies. While Mullvad at the time of writing does not seem to sponsor any content creators, it is in the same category as VPN companies, which matters for reputational reasons.
** <u>VPN review websites:</u> Most VPN review websites and reviews seem to be sponsored by VPN companies. This seems to be a [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windscribe/comments/18oi48c/im_starting_to_think_all_these_vpnreview_sites/ popular opinion].
** <u>Low Quality and Questionable Morality of VPNs generally:</u> VPNs often come across as low-quality due to their pervasive and morally dubious advertising practices. {{whonix_wiki

|text=this link
}} and press expand on the right side. This criticism is general and not directed at Mullvad, which does not seem to engage in such practices.
** <u>Implied Relationship of VPN Company Sponsoring:</u> If any Linux distribution (such as {{project_name_short}}) would install a browser by default that contains the branding of a VPN company (such as Mullvad Browser), this might lead to users strongly suspecting that the VPN company is paying the Linux distribution for this and as a result might have inappropriate influence over the Linux distributions. This would happen irrespective of whether there actually has been an advertisement deal or not. Disclaimers would only partially help as these might often either not be noticed or regarded as incredible.
** <u>Reputational impact:</u> Any reputation risk or damage is best avoided. Reputational integrity is deemed to be more foundational for the project's success than any technical advantages that any browser might provide.
** <u>Actual impact:</u> While the facts (non-existence of a sponsorship deal, no influence by the VPN company on the Linux distribution) are all positive, avoidance of easily confused and negative impressions is best pursued for pragmatic reasons to avoid jeopardizing the overall success of the project.
** <u>Conclusion:</u> To avoid any confusion, suspicion of having sold out, I have decided not to install any software by default that comes with branding or advertisements from any VPN companies.

== Tor Browser ==

Not an option by default in Kicksecure because it is torified, hence slow. For that use case, it would be better to use [[Whonix]]. See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

However, easily installable, opt-in for users of Kicksecure, see [[Tor Browser]].

== Tor Browser without Tor ==

As long as Tor Browser still says "Tor Browser" in the title bar, it will be too confusing. Same issue that {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=SecBrowser
|text=SecBrowser
}} had. Related: [[Dev/Default_Browser#In-House_Browser_Development|In-House Browser Development]]

== Base Browser ==

Both Mullvad Browser (MB) and Tor Browser (TB) are based on Base Browser (BB). However, Base Browser only exists as a source code repository. There are no binary builds available. Base Browser presumably has neither the Mullvad Browser nor Tor Browser branding, which is good. It is not separately maintained as a standalone project by any upstream. Not suitable for the same reasons as documented in chapter [[Dev/Default_Browser#Unbranded_or_Rebranded_Browser|Unbranded or Rebranded Browser]].

Feature Request [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/team/-/issues/28 Maintain a Standalone "Base Browser"] has been rejected.

== Unbranded or Rebranded Browser ==

Unbranded or Rebranded Browser is not a third-party project. It means that the {{project_name_short}} project would take an existing browser such as Mullvad Browser to unbrand or rebrand it.

This is not an option at this time because it is difficult and time-consuming to unbrand, for example, Mullvad Browser, and compile it. The maintenance effort is high and not justified given the current available project resources.

We also wanted to release close to upstream so we had the latest security patches ASAP but again, became unfeasible for our small team.

No, we are absolutely not prepared to do that. We are a (very) small team with a rather limited amount of time (and energy) to work on LibreWolf even with it just the way it currently is. We would not even remotely be able to fork and maintain a browser fully, let alone to continually develop and improve it. Nor would we have the expertise to do so. Which would mean that if we tried to do that, we would most certainly release an insecure product, getting worse over time, which I would not ever want to be responsible for.

Sorry to disappoint on that front – but: it is what it is.

== Waterfox ==
https://www.waterfox.net/

Developed by BrowserWorks Ltd. https://browser.works/ A soft-fork of Firefox. First released in March 2011<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfox</ref> and continuously maintained since then as of March 2025. Claims to not send any telemetry by default.

Several concerns listed at {{Github_link|repo=security-misc|path=/issues/192#issuecomment-2269688442}} Some additional concerns and comments:
* Very little information about Waterfox is visible on the front page, aside from general claims about security and privacy. Much more info is visible in the Waterfox blog at https://www.waterfox.net/blog/
* BrowserWorks' website is very minimal. It links to Waterfox Desktop, Waterfox Android, Waterfox Search (broken), and "Oblivious Proxy" (link appears to do nothing). The primary email address given for contacting BrowserWorks is someone's personal fastmail.com email address. This raises some maintainability concerns, though Waterfox has been continuously maintained for a long time.
* Waterfox is not "part of the hyper-privacy community" according to the lead developer. They recommend the use of Tor for users with high privacy requirements. https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-has-joined-system1/#ethics-and-privacy It is focused on speed and customization, it does not appear to have security hardening as a primary goal.
* No pre-built deb package, binaries are only available as a tarball.
* Only supports x86_64, no ARM64 binaries.
* Does NOT pass the radio silence test - Wireshark shows a flurry of activity as soon as Waterfox is launched for the first time, much of which appears to be connecting to Google's CDN.

== Pale Moon ==
https://www.palemoon.org/

Several concerns listed at {{Github_link|repo=security-misc|path=/issues/192#issuecomment-2276225662.}} Very small development team, potentially high risk of security vulnerabilities due to low developer resources. Extreme amounts of controversy and drama within the project have led to questionable decisions with regard to browser development (https://www.palemoon.org/history.shtml, section "2021, or: how Open Source ends"), and they report on this same history page that their infrastructure has been compromised at least once (section "A (failed) reboot into the Goanna Runtime Environment").

== GNUzilla / IceCat ==
* https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/
* https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gnuzilla

Developed by the Free Software Foundation. A Firefox ESR soft-fork. Appears to be actively maintained by a team of three developers<ref>From https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/: "The GNUzilla project is currently maintained by Ruben Rodriguez, Amin Bandali, and Mark H. Weaver. Please use the mailing lists for contact."</ref> as of March 2025. Additional features include:

* Non-free JavaScript blocking
* Blocks all third-party content linked to by web pages by default, thus automatically blocking ads
* Some forms of anti-fingerprinting (such as JShelter and avoiding leaking IP addresses when using WebRTC)
* Supposedly disabled telemetry<ref>https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/icecat</ref>

Cons:

* No official binaries available for any platform, must be built from source or installed via the Guix package manager
* Does not appear to have security hardening as a primary objective, though disabling non-free JS is a good step in that direction

== Trivalent ==
{{anchor|hardened-chromium}}
* https://github.com/secureblue/Trivalent
* Developed by the the secureblue project. A soft-fork of Chromium, basically applies two patch stacks on top of Fedora's packaged version of Chromium.
* Primary goal is security hardening.
* Uses patches from GrapheneOS's Vanadium project, a security-hardened Chromium soft-fork for Android. Explicitly designed to be used with hardened_malloc.
* Makes secondary browser features opt-in rather than opt-out (such as search suggestions).
* If it was available from packages.debian.org, Trivalent would be considered for being Kicksecure default browser.
* Only offers binaries for secureblue itself, unclear whether these binaries would work on even Fedora.
* Fedora-centric build process, may be difficult or very difficult to build for Debian.

== Ladybird ==
* https://ladybird.org/
* Fully independent web browser, not based on Firefox or Chromium.
* Still in early development, not generally usable and very likely has security issues in its current state of development.
* May be usable in the future, once mature and packaged for Debian. Will likely require multiple years more development before it is secure and usable.

== Customized Settings Projects ==
There are a number of projects that provide customized settings for Firefox. It is unlikely that most of these projects will be useful to Kicksecure, since they may enable settings that are potentially dangerous or disable settings that users need enabled, thus adding extra risk and support burden to the project. They are listed together here since they are not really web browsers, simply different ways of configuring existing browsers.

=== ffprofile.com ===
* https://ffprofile.com/
* https://github.com/allo-/ffprofile

Creates custom configuration profiles for Firefox, allowing one to customize a large number of settings that Firefox does not directly expose to the user. Can also provide features beyond ones included in Firefox by default via browser extensions.

* Provides a wizard-like user interface to the end user for selecting settings.
* Takes all of the input from the user, and builds it into two files, <code>profile.zip</code> and <code>enterprise_policy.zip</code>. The user is supposed to then unzip these files into appropriate directories to apply their selected settings to the web browser.
* Pros:
** Allows customizing a large number of privacy-related features, including disabling telemetry and features that could be used to more easily track a user.
** Relatively intuitive, wizard-like user interface, with each page similar to an application's settings dialog. Much easier to use than having to fiddle with <code>about:config</code> and enterprise policy JSON manually.
** Avoids some of the problems with opinionated configuration projects such as arkenfox, Betterfox, and the like - the user gets to choose their own settings rather than living with whatever settings a random stranger decided was good for them.
* Cons:
** The profile config files are built ''on the server side'', not on the client side in the web browser itself, meaning if the project's web server is compromised, it may serve compromised zip files.
** Can bundle Firefox extensions into the zip files, further increasing the damage a web server compromise could do.
** Running locally requires setting up a local web app, which is non-trivial. You can't just download it and run it.
** The extensions appear to be stored directly on the host server, not downloaded dynamically from Mozilla. This further increases the risk of a compromised project.
** Requires the user to manually unzip the built files into the correct directories. This is arguably the best that a web app can do, however this is likely to be a very challenging step for non-technical users, and may even be slightly tricky for technical users.
** To avoid trusting the project to be fully trustworthy, the end user would have to read through the entire generated configuration, ensuring no harmful features were enabled, and no important features were disabled. Browser addons would also have to be removed from the configuration, and then manually installed by the end user directly from Mozilla.
** The applicable versions of Firefox are not spelled out on the website, thus it is unclear if all of the configuration options are actually available in Firefox ESR or if attempting to enable them would break Firefox ESR.
* Potential ideas:
** Re-implement an audited version of ffprofile as a desktop app and include in Kicksecure? The app would be able to download addons from Mozilla directly (if it offered addons as a feature), install configuration automatically, and would come from a source users of Kicksecure already trust. Configuration builds would also be done client-side, removing most of the risks inherent if a compromised server provided the configuration.
** Would require a simple "use recommended settings, please proceed" button for most users.

/*** [SECTION 8500]: TELEMETRY
   Arkenfox does not consider Firefox telemetry to be a privacy or security concern - comments below. But
   since most arkenfox users prefer it disabled for peace of mind, we'll do that rather than cause overrides.

   Opt-out
   - Telemetry is essential: a browser engine is a _very_ large complex beast costing billions to maintain
   - Opt-in telemetry _does not_ work and results in data that is unrepresentative and may be misleading
   Choice
   - Every new profile on first use provides data collection/use policy and the abillty to opt-out
   - It can be disabled at any time (Settings>Privacy & Security>Data Collection and Use)
   Data
   - no PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
   - all data can be viewed in about:telemetry
   - uses Prio [1][2][3], Glean [4], Oblivious HTTP [5][6]

   Firefox code is open source. Mozilla is responsible with opt-out. They are transparent, and they have gone
   above and beyond in terms of privacy preserving technologies. At this point, if you don't trust Firefox,
   then why are you using their browser?
   - not to be confused with holding them to a higher standard and checking browser changes/implementations

'''Non-issues:'''

* https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1795
* Telemetry. Ticket https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1660 is confusing but it's not about enabling telemetry. Only about moving it to its own section in the config file. Which is more like a textual, stylistic change.
* Using <code>pref(</code> instead of <code>user_pref(</code> is not an issue as per: {{Github_link|repo=security-misc|path=/pull/183#issuecomment-1895948795}}

That could easily be handled during the package build process with something like this:

<pre>
search='pref("'
replace='user_pref("'
file_name='user.js'
str_replace "$search" "$replace" "$file_name"
</pre>

The <code>diff</code> would be reasonably simple.
