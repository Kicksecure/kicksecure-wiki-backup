Default Browser Considerations for {{project_name_short}}.
}}
= {{project_name_short}} Default Browser Considerations =
== Introduction ==
[[Kicksecure]] is primarily a security focused Linux distribution. Preferring security over privacy if such a decision is unavoidable. However, {{project_name_short}} will never implement outrageous privacy violations. It will even provider slightly better privacy than most other Linux distributions (such as no popularity contest installed), but otherwise no huge efforts to optimize privacy such as in {{whonix}}. (And yet, {{project_name_short}} would be a suitable host for {{project_name_long}} until {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Whonix-Host
|text=Whonix-Host
}} materializes. No contradiction here since {{project_name_long}} works fine on top of any secure Linux distribution that does not implement outrageous privacy violations.)

[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html Chromium is more secure than Firefox.] <ref>
[[Dev/Chromium#Firefox_and_Chromium_Security]]
</ref> Therefore would be the natural choice as default browser for Kicksecure.

[https://forums.whonix.org/t/very-hard-to-notice-phishing-scam-firefox-tor-browser-url-not-showing-real-domain-name-homograph-attack-punycode/8373 very hard to notice Phishing Scam - Firefox / Tor Browser URL not showing real Domain Name - Homograph attack (Punycode)]

Even if Firefox would provide better privacy than Chromium, this would still not speak in favor of choosing Firefox as the only browser installed by default in {{project_name_short}} because as elaborated in the first paragraph in this chapter, {{project_name_short}} is primarily a security focused Linux distribution.

Other browsers not available from packages.debian.org are not considered (at least not in initial versions) because {{project_name_short}} will have a similar default application to [[Dev/Default_Application_Policy|default application policy]].

However, Firefox should be preferred for reasons other than security and privacy, see [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Beyond_Licensing|threats to user freedom thorough market share domination]]. [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_reduced_capabilities_to_plugin_with_adblocker|In future, Firefox might have better advertisement blocking capabilities?]]

<s>[[SecBrowser]] (was a browser providing better privacy when browsing clearnet) will not be installed by default in {{project_name_short}} because of grave usability issues, namely its window bar is still saying "Tor Browser" rather than Firefox or SecBrowser. That would be too confusing for new users of {{project_name_short}}. SecBrowser is deprecated. Also Chromium is more secure than SecBrowser.</s>

See also these [[Dev/Chromium|Chromium considerations]].

Therefore the decision which browser to install by default in {{project_name_short}} is a difficult one.

To not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,

* <s>it's been decided to install Chromium by default in the initial versions of Kicksecure.</s>
* Update: Nowadays Firefox is installed by default due to [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_Debian_Package_Security|Chromium Debian Package Security]].

The decision is based on practicality, available resources, achievable initial goals. It is a significant development effort to create a dedicated website for {{project_name_short}} and to create a new Linux distribution. {{project_name_short}} doesn't have to find solutions to the difficult mostly globally unaddressed [[Miscellaneous Threats to User Freedom]] right from the start.

See also [[#Potential Future Solutions]] which might be implemented in later stages of the development.

== Disregarded Solutions ==
=== no browser installed by default ===

* That would be a terrible user experience, specifically for Live ISO / USB users, waiting until all browser related packages are downloaded and installed using APT. Users want ready to go solution. The fact that they already have to invest time to get a new operating system is already a barrier. Asking them to wait till a browser downloads is too much.

=== install both firefox-esr and chromium by default ===

* a waste of disk space
* longer update times as both packages are downloaded in the future
* not a strong stance against chromium

== Potential Future Solutions ==
Might be implemented in a later version but not in the initial versions.

=== Browser Choice Dialog ===

Similar to this:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/BrowserChoice.gif

During the build process of {{project_name_short}} download (cache) both packages, firefox-esr and chormium but don't install these. This is to avoid avoid APT traffic and time wasted on network download. In more technical terms, similar to this:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --download-only firefox-esr
sudo apt install --download-only chromium
</pre>

The packages will then be cached but didn't actually install the packages. These downloaded packages files will reside in folder <code>/var/cache/apt/archives</code> and otherwise do nothing. Would be cleaned up once the user runs <code>sudo apt clean</code>.

That would work well for ISO release but not for installation from repository. The latter not sure how important long term, perhaps for servers (server vendors won't offer {{project_name_short}} pre-install very soon) but then for servers no browser is required.

Not sure yet this can work with the ISO build process.

Also after first boot there is a technical issue. Suppose users would run <code>sudo apt update</code> followed by <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code> before ever starting a browser, which is recommended and good security practice. Then when running the browser choice dialog (through clicking browser icon in start menu)...

At this point the user most likely the browser choice tool cannot run <code>sudo apt install firefox-esr</code> or <code>sudo apt install chromium</code> on behalf of the user without network traffic. This is because dependencies, package versions changed meanwhile. (User run <code>sudo apt update</code> would have noticed that.) This decreases usability. Thereby the browser choice tool would be changed from <code>offline install previously downloaded browser package</code> to <code>network dependent download and install of browser</code>.

To keep the browser choice tool <code>offline install previously downloaded browser package</code> should the browser choice be a popup at first boot?

There might be technical solutions for all of this but this makes the default browser choice a major development task.

=== draft text for browser choice dialog ===
Not relevant yet since the browser choice dialog will not be implemented soon.

<blockquote> {{project_name_short}} supports any Debian compatible browser, but defaults to two major choices: Chromium and Firefox.

* Firefox - Pros: Keeps the web open and free as we know it. [https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html Less secure.]

* Chromium - Pros: More secure. Cons: Increases [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#chromium|Google's influence, which may harm user freedom and choice in the future]].

Please make a selection:

[x] Firefox<br />
[ ] Chromium<br />
[ ] Do not install any browser at this time<br />
[ ] Do not ask again<br />
[ ] Quit<br />
</blockquote>

** https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm
** DRM test website: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm
* '''Needs hardening:''' Not as hardened by default (lower attack surface, disabled telemetry) as it could be creating demand for a hardened Firefox fork or Firefox settings project such as arkenfox.

'''Enabling non-freedom DRM is just 1 click away:'''

'''TODO:'''

* As part of taming Firefox, a Firefox settings project such as arkenfox or Firefox might make it harder to accidentally enable DRM?

=== Firefox directly from Upstream Mozilla using Flatpak ===
'''advantages:'''

* Fast stable Firefox upgrades directly from upstream, Mozilla.

'''issues:'''

* Most likely ignores <code>/etc/firefox</code> settings folder. It is most likely possible to add a workaround for that.

advantages:

* Fast stable Firefox upgrades directly from upstream, Mozilla.

potential issues:

* TODO: Does it honor <code>/etc/firefox</code> settings folder? It might not as this might only be a feature by Debian's firefox-esr package.

disadvantages:

* Same as in above wiki chapter.

= About the Debian specific patches =

Mozilla recognizes that patches applied to Iceweasel/Firefox don't
impact the quality of the product.
Patches which should be reported upstream to improve the product always
have been forward upstream by the Debian packagers. Mozilla agrees about
specific patches to facilitate the support of Iceweasel on architecture
supported by Debian or Debian-specific patches.

More generally, Mozilla trusts the Debian packagers to use their best
judgment to achieve the same quality as the official Firefox binaries.

In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.
Ubuntu having a different packaging, this does not apply to that
distribution.
|context=Debian issue tracker, [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006 Renaming Iceweasel to Firefox]
}}

Opinion by a non-lawyer:

The phrasing <code>can be used as long as the patches applied are in the same category as described above</code> could be interpreted as in a patch which disables all telemetry, tracking and phone-home as much as possible would be in a different category and hence might in the viewpoint of Mozillla violate their trademark.

'''[https://github.com/portapps/phyrox-portable/issues/11 Mozilla vs portapps.io]''' from 2019

== arkenfox ==
https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js

A settings file improving Firefox security and privacy.

'''todo'''

'''advantages:'''

* disabled telemetry by default

'''non-issues:'''

* https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1795
* Telemetry. Ticket https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1660 is confusing but it's not about enabling telemetry. Only about moving it to its own section in the config file. Which is more like a textual, stylistic change.
* using <code>pref(</code> instead of <code>user_pref(</code> is not an issue as per https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/pull/183#issuecomment-1895948795

That could easily be handeld during the package build process with something like this:

<pre>
search='pref("'
replace='user_pref("'
file_name='user.js'
str_replace "$search" "$replace" "$file_name"
</pre>

The <code>diff</code> would be reasonably simple.

== deskapps-harden ==
https://github.com/monsieuremre/deskapps-harden

A settings file improving Firefox security and privacy.

'''todo:'''

* discuss if settings locking is really neccessary: https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/issues/192#issuecomment-1905981518

'''advantages:'''

* responsive upstream
* founded by Kicksecure contributor
* clean, small, policy, single 1 file

'''disadvantages:'''

* new project
* few users, bug reports, feature requests yet, hence difficult to judge the merits of the project
* no known third-party reviews yet
* project name might be too limiting to gain lots of non-Kicksecure users using the same, which would be an advantage to get more users (fingerprint shared by moer users and hopefully more review, suggestions)

== LibreWolf ==
Lags behind Firefox a few days up to 1 week.

{{quotation
|quote=Regarding Librewolf’s slow updates, I think this issue has been very greatly exaggerated, having used it as one of my browsers for almost over 30 months, I personally do not recall it ever really being more than one week behind Firefox, usually it is only a couple working days at worst.
|context=https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/issues/192#issuecomment-1910407278
}}

== LibreFox ==
https://github.com/intika/Librefox is dead as per https://github.com/intika/Librefox/issues/141

https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/ is active.

Potential past legal issue with Mozilla:

* https://github.com/intika/Librefox/commit/45a4d3ce647b8c896e81ce3e5ac5ddc95ff045e0 mentions legal issues.
* question about it: https://github.com/intika/Librefox/issues/125#issuecomment-1913347606

[https://github.com/intika intika], the developer of Librefox disappeared. The website [https://linuxhacks.org/ linuxhacks.org] is still online so one could assume that someone is still paying the bills. Still active on [https://stackexchange.com/users/3950473/intika?tab=activity stackexchange].

== Mullvad Browser ==
https://mullvad.net/en/browser

'''{{project_name_short}} user documentation:''' [[Mullvad Browser]]

'''Advantages:'''

* anti-browser fingerprinting
* It seems unlikely that the project will be deprecated because Mullvad exists as a company already for a long time.
* VPN
** Does not enforce using a VPN by default.
* Security slider

'''Disadvantages:'''

* VPN
** Could confuse users to believe they are using a VPN by default they are not. When using a Mullvad Browser it seems reasonable to assume that a browser developed by VPN provider Mullvad would use Mullvad VPN by default.
* Based on Firefox ESR (extended support release).
* Not vendor neutral
** Comes with branding 
*** default browser homepage
**** <blockquote>MULLVAD BROWSER</blockquote>
**** <blockquote>Developed in collaboration between the Tor Project and Mullvad VPN</blockquote>
*** Comes with Mullvad Browser extension by default.
**** <code>Disable Mullvad DoH (encrypted DNS)</code>
* DNS
** [https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls#when-to-use DoH (DNS over HTTPS) enabled by default]
** Used Mullvad for DNS by default.
** Could be controversial.
** If Kicksecure was to change DNS settings by default it should do so system with for consistency and not only in the browser.
** See also: [[DNS_Security]]
** related: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 Use DNSCrypt by default in Kicksecure? (not Whonix!)]

'''Other:'''

* comes with ublock origin by default
** but not enabled by default

'''Packaging Mullvad Browser (MB):'''

* That would need to be done, maintained by upstream. Since MB is similar to TB (Tor Browser) where a `.deb` feature request is ~ 11 years old and rejected, my hopes aren't so high that this is going to happen. Happy to be wrong about this.

== Tor Browser ==
Not an option by default in Kicksecure because it is torified, hence slow. For that use case it would be better to use [[Whonix]]. See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

However, easily installable, opt-in for users of Kicksecure, see [[Tor Browser]].

== Unbranded or Rebranded Browser ==
Not an option because difficult, time consuming to unbrand for example Mullvad Browser, compile it. High maintenance effort. Not justified with the current available project resources.

= Criteria =
Primary importance for Kicksecure must be security. Anti-fingerprinting is nice but secondary. Disabled telemetry can be considered a security feature since it lowers attack surface and a privacy feature.
