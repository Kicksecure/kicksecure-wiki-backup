= {{project_name_short}} Default Browser Considerations =
== Introduction ==
[[Kicksecure]] is primarily a security focused Linux distribution. Preferring security over privacy if such a decision is unavoidable. However, {{project_name_short}} will never implement outrageous privacy violations. It will even provide slightly better privacy than most other Linux distributions (such as no popularity contest installed), but otherwise no huge efforts to optimize privacy such as in {{whonix}}. (And yet, {{project_name_short}} would be a suitable host for {{project_name_long}} until {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Whonix-Host
|text=Whonix-Host
}} materializes. No contradiction here since {{project_name_long}} works fine on top of any secure Linux distribution that does not implement outrageous privacy violations.) See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html Chromium might be more secure than Firefox.] <ref>
[[Dev/Chromium#Firefox_and_Chromium_Security]]
</ref> Therefore would be the natural choice as default browser for Kicksecure.

[https://forums.whonix.org/t/very-hard-to-notice-phishing-scam-firefox-tor-browser-url-not-showing-real-domain-name-homograph-attack-punycode/8373 very hard to notice Phishing Scam - Firefox / Tor Browser URL not showing real Domain Name - Homograph attack (Punycode)]

Even if Firefox would provide better privacy than Chromium, this would still not speak in favor of choosing Firefox as the only browser installed by default in {{project_name_short}} because as elaborated in the first paragraph in this chapter, {{project_name_short}} is primarily a security focused Linux distribution.

Other browsers not available from packages.debian.org are not considered (at least not in initial versions) because {{project_name_short}} will have a default application policy similar to {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/Default_Application_Policy
|text=Whonix default application policy
}}.

However, Firefox should be preferred for reasons other than security and privacy, see [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Beyond_Licensing|threats to user freedom through market share domination]]. [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_reduced_capabilities_to_plugin_with_adblocker|In future, Firefox might have better advertising blocking capabilities?]]

See also these [[Dev/Chromium|Chromium considerations]].

Therefore the decision which browser to install by default in {{project_name_short}} is a difficult one.

To not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,

Nowadays Firefox is installed by default due to [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_Debian_Package_Security|Chromium Debian Package Security Issues]].

The decision is based on practicality, available resources, achievable initial goals. It is a significant development effort to create a dedicated website for {{project_name_short}} and to create a new Linux distribution. {{project_name_short}} doesn't have to find solutions to the difficult mostly globally unaddressed [[Miscellaneous Threats to User Freedom]] right from the start.

See also [[#Potential Future Solutions]] which might be implemented in later stages of the development.

== Disregarded Solutions ==
=== no browser installed by default ===

* That would be a terrible user experience, specifically for Live ISO / USB users, waiting until all browser related packages are downloaded and installed using APT. Users want ready to go solution. The fact that they already have to invest time to get a new operating system is already a barrier. Asking them to wait till a browser downloads is too much.

=== install both firefox-esr and chromium by default ===

* a waste of disk space
* longer update times as both packages are downloaded in the future
* not a strong stance against chromium

== Potential Future Solutions ==
Might be implemented in a later version but not in the initial versions.

=== Browser Choice Dialog ===

Similar to this:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/BrowserChoice.gif

During the build process of {{project_name_short}} download (cache) both packages, firefox-esr and chromium but don't install these. This is to avoid APT traffic and time wasted on network download. In more technical terms, similar to this:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --download-only firefox-esr
sudo apt install --download-only chromium
</pre>

The packages will then be cached but didn't actually install the packages. These downloaded packages files will reside in folder <code>/var/cache/apt/archives</code> and otherwise do nothing. Would be cleaned up once the user runs <code>sudo apt clean</code>.

That would work well for ISO release but not for installation from repository. The latter not sure how important long term, perhaps for servers (server vendors won't offer {{project_name_short}} pre-install very soon) but then for servers no browser is required.

Not sure yet this can work with the ISO build process.

Also after first boot there is a technical issue. Suppose users would run <code>sudo apt update</code> followed by <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code> before ever starting a browser, which is recommended and good security practice. Then when running the browser choice dialog (through clicking browser icon in start menu)...

At this point the user most likely the browser choice tool cannot run <code>sudo apt install firefox-esr</code> or <code>sudo apt install chromium</code> on behalf of the user without network traffic. This is because dependencies, package versions changed meanwhile. (User run <code>sudo apt update</code> would have noticed that.) This decreases usability. Thereby the browser choice tool would be changed from <code>offline install previously downloaded browser package</code> to <code>network dependent download and install of browser</code>.

To keep the browser choice tool <code>offline install previously downloaded browser package</code> should the browser choice be a popup at first boot?

There might be technical solutions for all of this but this makes the default browser choice a major development task.

=== draft text for browser choice dialog ===
Not relevant yet since the browser choice dialog will not be implemented soon.

<blockquote> {{project_name_short}} supports any Debian compatible browser, but defaults to two major choices: Chromium and Firefox.

* Firefox - Pros: Keeps the web open and free as we know it. [https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html Less secure.]

* Chromium - Pros: More secure. Cons: Increases [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#chromium|Google's influence, which may harm user freedom and choice in the future]].

Please make a selection:

[x] Firefox<br />
[ ] Chromium<br />
[ ] Do not install any browser at this time<br />
[ ] Do not ask again<br />
[ ] Quit<br />
</blockquote>

Domain name will change to kicksecure.com.

= About the Debian specific patches =

Mozilla recognizes that patches applied to Iceweasel/Firefox don't
impact the quality of the product.
Patches which should be reported upstream to improve the product always
have been forward upstream by the Debian packagers. Mozilla agrees about
specific patches to facilitate the support of Iceweasel on architecture
supported by Debian or Debian-specific patches.

More generally, Mozilla trusts the Debian packagers to use their best
judgment to achieve the same quality as the official Firefox binaries.

In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.
Ubuntu having a different packaging, this does not apply to that
distribution.
|context=Debian issue tracker, [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006 Renaming Iceweasel to Firefox]
}}

Opinion by a non-lawyer:

The phrasing <code>can be used as long as the patches applied are in the same category as described above</code> could be interpreted as in a patch which disables all telemetry, tracking and phone-home as much as possible would be in a different category and hence might in the viewpoint of Mozillla violate their trademark.

Does this apply to Linux distributions that is not really primarily about distributing Firefox? Probably yes, since Mozilla had also a past conflict with Debian.

Kicksecure Default Browser Configuration Trademark Question
</pre>

body:

<pre>
I am the lead developer of the Kicksecure project, a Linux distribution focused on security and based on Debian. Kicksecure is developed by the same team as Whonix, which is somewhat more well-known.

Our hardened defaults extend to the default user applications on the system, including a daily drivable web browser.

We are currently in the process of reviewing and considering potential candidates to be the default web browser on Kicksecure.

With good intentions, various Kicksecure contributors have suggested shipping Mozilla Firefox as the default browser. However, some contributors, including myself, are concerned about the modifications to Firefox's default settings we intend to make, versus Mozilla's Trademark Policy. We have no intention of rebranding or changing the compilation options of Firefox binaries. In fact, we prefer to keep the Mozilla trademarked names for the products to provide our users with a sense of familiarity.

We would acquire unaltered binaries from one of the following sources:

- Debian's official packages.debian.org repository
- Mozilla's official packages.mozilla.org repository
- Mozilla's official Firefox Flathub repository

Ideally, we would use Mozilla sources.

Here is a trademark-respecting list of things we are aware of and want to avoid for understandable reasons:

* Not using Mozilla trademarks in the name of our business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
* Not using marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to Mozilla trademarks.
* Not using Mozilla trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Mozilla of our products or services.
* Not displaying Mozilla trademarks more prominently than our product, service, or company name.
* Not using Mozilla trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)
* Not using Mozilla trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g., offering technical support services), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g., “Independent technical support for Mozilla’s Firefox browser”).
* Not modifying Mozilla’s trademarks, abbreviating them, or combining them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporating them into a tagline or slogan.

And here is a list of things that we would like to do. Our primary intention is to have a default policy (or employ other means if more appropriate) to do the following:

* Use unaltered binaries.
* Disable all Telemetry, Studies, Reports, and non-essential implicit outgoing connections.
* Force install the addon "uBlock Origin" by Raymond Hill.
* Set and lock hardened SSL/TLS-related settings, including, but not limited to, setting HTTPS-only mode as the default, blocking mixed content, not trusting unsafe negotiations, disabling unencrypted background requests, etc.
* Disable sponsored components, like bookmarks and suggestions.
* Set and lock strict mode for ETP.
* Change the default homepage.
* Disable the default display of the "Know Your Rights" information page.

As an illustrative point of how specifically we plan to apply these changes:

- Our intended changes would be made by providing a separate package (for example, named "hardened-browser-config").
- This package would install config file(s) in folder(s) such as /etc/firefox or /etc/firefox-esr.
- The package would be installed by default.

We are willing to elaborate on the details and consider making modifications upon request by Mozilla.

We are not asking for any special permission that does not extend to derivatives. As stated on the Debian issue tracker:

> In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used as long
> as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.

This is related to the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) (item 8):

> License must not be specific to Debian
>
> The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the Debian system.

We would like to be able to state similarly:

> In case of derivatives of Kicksecure, Firefox branding can be used as long as the patches applied are in the same category as described above.

We are asking for your opinion on whether this would be in conflict with Mozilla's Trademark Policy.

We intend to publish our correspondence for the sake of transparency. Our communications and your responses will be publicized in full, verbatim, without modifications.

Patrick,

Thanks for your email.

Unfortunately the changes you would like to make do not comply with our
distribution policy
<https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/distribution-policy/>,
including the following:

You may not add to, remove, or change any part of the software, including
the Mozilla trademarks themselves. For example, you may not add any
extensions to Firefox, change default settings, or alter search codes.

If you would like to distribute Firefox unmodified, you can use our .deb.

You can, of course, make any modifications you wish to Firefox’s open
source software if you distribute a browser without Mozilla and Firefox
trademarks. Based on your requirements, the Tor Browser might also be an
option you could consider.

<br>
Our hardened defaults extend to the default user applications on the <br>
system, including a daily drivable web browser.<br>
<br>
We are currently in the process of reviewing and considering potential <br>
candidates to be the default web browser on Kicksecure.<br>
<br>
With good intentions, various Kicksecure contributors have suggested <br>
shipping Mozilla Firefox as the default browser. However, some <br>
contributors, including myself, are concerned about the modifications to <b=
r>
Firefox&#39;s default settings we intend to make, versus Mozilla&#39;s Trad=
emark <br>
Policy. We have no intention of rebranding or changing the compilation <br>
options of Firefox binaries. In fact, we prefer to keep the Mozilla <br>
trademarked names for the products to provide our users with a sense of <br=
>
familiarity.<br>
<br>
We would acquire unaltered binaries from one of the following sources:<br>
<br>
- Debian&#39;s official <a href=3D"http://packages.debian.org" rel=3D"noref=
errer" target=3D"_blank">packages.debian.org</a> repository<br>
- Mozilla&#39;s official <a href=3D"http://packages.mozilla.org" rel=3D"nor=
eferrer" target=3D"_blank">packages.mozilla.org</a> repository<br>
- Mozilla&#39;s official Firefox Flathub repository<br>
<br>
Ideally, we would use Mozilla sources.<br>
<br>
Here is a trademark-respecting list of things we are aware of and want <br>
to avoid for understandable reasons:<br>
<br>
* Not using Mozilla trademarks in the name of our business, product, <br>
service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.<br>
* Not using marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or <br>
designs that are confusingly similar to Mozilla trademarks.<br>
* Not using Mozilla trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies <br>
affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Mozilla of <b=
r>
our products or services.<br>
* Not displaying Mozilla trademarks more prominently than our product, <br>
service, or company name.<br>
* Not using Mozilla trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling <br>
t-shirts, mugs, etc.)<br>
* Not using Mozilla trademarks for any other form of commercial use <br>
(e.g., offering technical support services), unless such use is limited <br=
>
to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g., =E2=80=9CIndependent technic=

support for Mozilla=E2=80=99s Firefox browser=E2=80=9D).<br>
* Not modifying Mozilla=E2=80=99s trademarks, abbreviating them, or combini=
ng <br>
them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporating them <br>
into a tagline or slogan.<br>
<br>
And here is a list of things that we would like to do. Our primary <br>
intention is to have a default policy (or employ other means if more <br>
appropriate) to do the following:<br>
<br>
* Use unaltered binaries.<br>
* Disable all Telemetry, Studies, Reports, and non-essential implicit <br>
outgoing connections.<br>
* Force install the addon &quot;uBlock Origin&quot; by Raymond Hill.<br>
* Set and lock hardened SSL/TLS-related settings, including, but not <br>
limited to, setting HTTPS-only mode as the default, blocking mixed <br>
content, not trusting unsafe negotiations, disabling unencrypted <br>
background requests, etc.<br>
* Disable sponsored components, like bookmarks and suggestions.<br>
* Set and lock strict mode for ETP.<br>
* Change the default homepage.<br>
* Disable the default display of the &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; informati=
on page.<br>
<br>
As an illustrative point of how specifically we plan to apply these changes=
:<br>
<br>
- Our intended changes would be made by providing a separate package <br>
(for example, named &quot;hardened-browser-config&quot;).<br>
- This package would install config file(s) in folder(s) such as <br>
/etc/firefox or /etc/firefox-esr.<br>
- The package would be installed by default.<br>
<br>
We are willing to elaborate on the details and consider making <br>
modifications upon request by Mozilla.<br>
<br>
We are not asking for any special permission that does not extend to <br>
derivatives. As stated on the Debian issue tracker:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0&gt; In case of derivatives of Debian, Firefox branding can be used a=
s long<br>

<pre>
/*** [SECTION 8500]: TELEMETRY
   Arkenfox does not consider Firefox telemetry to be a privacy or security concern - comments below. But
   since most arkenfox users prefer it disabled for peace of mind, we'll do that rather than cause overrides.

   Opt-out
   - Telemetry is essential: a browser engine is a _very_ large complex beast costing billions to maintain
   - Opt-in telemetry _does not_ work and results in data that is unrepresentative and may be misleading
   Choice
   - Every new profile on first use provides data collection/use policy and the abillty to opt-out
   - It can be disabled at any time (Settings>Privacy & Security>Data Collection and Use) 
   Data
   - no PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
   - all data can be viewed in about:telemetry
   - uses Prio [1][2][3], Glean [4], Oblivious HTTP [5][6]

   Firefox code is open source. Mozilla is responsible with opt-out. They are transparent, and they have gone
   above and beyond in terms of privacy preserving technologies. At this point, if you don't trust Firefox,
   then why are you using their browser?
   - not to be confused with holding them to a higher standard and checking browser changes/implementations

'''non-issues:'''

* https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1795
* Telemetry. Ticket https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1660 is confusing but it's not about enabling telemetry. Only about moving it to its own section in the config file. Which is more like a textual, stylistic change.
* using <code>pref(</code> instead of <code>user_pref(</code> is not an issue as per https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/pull/183#issuecomment-1895948795

That could easily be handled during the package build process with something like this:

<pre>
search='pref("'
replace='user_pref("'
file_name='user.js'
str_replace "$search" "$replace" "$file_name"
</pre>

The <code>diff</code> would be reasonably simple.

== Mullvad Browser ==
'''Upstream Documentation:'''

* https://mullvad.net/en/browser
* https://mullvad.net/en/browser/hard-facts

'''{{project_name_short}} user documentation:'''

* <u>Opt-in Installation:</u> Users can easily opt-in to install [[Mullvad Browser]] (MB).

'''Advantages:'''

* <u>Anti-browser fingerprinting:</u> Provides enhanced privacy by preventing tracking through browser fingerprint techniques.
* <u>Company stability:</u> Unlikely to be deprecated, as Mullvad has been established for a significant duration.
* <u>VPN support:</u> Compatible with VPNs, though does not require one by default.
* <u>Security features:</u> Includes a security slider for customizable security settings.
* <u>Software compatibility:</u> Supported by tb-updater and tb-starter, as noted in {{project_name_short}} user documentation.

'''Disadvantages:'''

* <u>Vendor branding:</u> Features specific Mullvad branding, therefore not vendor-neutral.
** <u>Home page and extensions:</u> Includes a default homepage and browser extension specific to Mullvad.
*** <blockquote>MULLVAD BROWSER</blockquote>
*** <blockquote>Developed in collaboration between the Tor Project and Mullvad VPN</blockquote>
*** <code>Disable Mullvad DoH (encrypted DNS)</code>
* <u>Purpose of browser:</u>
** <u>Opinion:</u> This is interpretation, opinion based.
*** A) <u>Mullvad users:</u> MB's primary purpose is to increase the usefulness of Mullvad's VPN service.
*** B) <u>Advertisement:</u> MB serves as a distinguishing advantage over Mullvad's competitors and an advertisement for Mullvad.
*** C) <u>Non-Mullvad users:</u> Enhanced privacy and security.
* <u>VPN confusion:</u> Users might mistakenly believe that the VPN is active by default. This is addressed in the [[Mullvad_Browser#Mullvad_VPN|Mullvad VPN]] section of the user documentation.
* <u>Browser basis:</u> Based on Firefox ESR (extended support release), not the latest stable version of Firefox.
* <u>DNS configuration:</u>
** <u>Mullvad Browser default DNS configuration:</u> DNS over HTTPS enabled by default, utilizing Mullvad's services.
** <u>Privacy implications:</u> Not the DNS server a user or corporate might have configured (such as on the router level) will be used but Mullvad's DNS server. Therefore Mullvad will also learn all DNS queries by the user.
** <u>Violation of separation of power:</u> For example, the developers of Tor do not host Tor relays. One party is maintaining the software and other parties are maintaining the infrastructure. Similarly, it could be argued browser developers should only maintain the browser but stay neutral regarding network infrastructure.
** <u>DNS settings inconsistency:</u> This leads to inconsistency with system-wide DNS settings. There would be one set of DNS settings for the system and a different set of settings for Mullvad Browser.
** <u>Usability:</u> This is a violation of the principle of least astonishment (POLA).
** <u>Increased DNS Configuration Changes Complexity:</u> Changes to system DNS settings by the user or Kicksecure should apply consistently across the entire system, including the browser. Using separate DNS settings in MB could complicate development of a more secure default system DNS configuration and cause the browser to use different DNS settings than the system default.
** <u>See also:</u> [[DNS Security]] and the forum discussion [https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-dnscrypt-by-default-in-kicksecure-not-whonix/8117 Use DNSCrypt by default in Kicksecure? (not Whonix)].
* <u>Usability:</u>
** <u>No stored logins:</u> Does not save logins because Mullvad Browser does not save cookies after a browser restart. Therefore, users would have to log in repeatedly.
** <u>No password manager:</u> Does not come with a password manager by default. Users would need to re-enter their passwords for pages where they intend to use logins repeatedly. <ref>
* Quote Mullvad: [https://mullvad.net/en/browser/hard-facts The Mullvad Browser hard facts: list of settings and modifications.]: <blockquote>No password manager (it's better to keep the password manager as a separate tool)</blockquote>
* Mullvad Browser issue: [https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser/issues/137 MISSING: Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Logins and passwords -> Ask to save logins and passwords for websites]
</ref>

'''Other:'''

* <u>uBlock Origin:</u> Pre-installed but not enabled by default.

'''Packaging Mullvad Browser (MB):'''

* <u>Future packaging plans:</u> Efforts to release deb/rpm packages are confirmed for this year.
** <blockquote>Getting deb/rpm package for Mullvad Browser is firmly in the plans for this year.</blockquote>
* MB feature request: [https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser/issues/201 Add rpm/deb package repositories?]

* https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/tor-project-is-resurrecting-secbrowser-as-mullvad-browser/101

'''Mullvad Browser as {{project_name_short}} Default Browser'''

* <u>Summary:</u> No. This is a [[Declined|declined feature request]]. Details? See below.
* <u>Comparison with others:</u> No other Linux distribution is installing Mullvad Browser by default. This implies that such a decision needs to be considered with extra care.
** <u>Qubes:</u> At time of writing, there is [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+mullvad+in%3Atitle no Mullvad Browser related feature request at the Qubes issue tracker].
* <u>Opinion:</u> By {{project_name_short}} founder and developer:
** <u>Trademark:</u> No trademark policy issues.
** <u>Not vendor neutral:</u> Unfortunately, Mullvad Browser is not a vendor-neutral browser project as [[#Base_Browser|Base Browser]] might be.
** <u>Community project vs corporate project:</u> MB is developed by a VPN company and not a community project solely focusing on maintaining an independent web browser.
** <u>Omnipresent VPN company advertisements:</u> Many or even most podcasts, popular YouTube channels, and so forth contain advertisements for VPN companies. While Mullvad at the time of writing does not seem to sponsor any content creators, it is in the same category as VPN companies, which matters for reputational reasons.
** <u>VPN review websites:</u> Most VPN review websites and reviews seem to be sponsored by VPN companies. This seems to be a [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windscribe/comments/18oi48c/im_starting_to_think_all_these_vpnreview_sites/ popular opinion].
** <u>Low Quality and Questionable Morality of VPNs generally:</u> VPNs often come across as low-quality due to their pervasive and morally dubious advertising practices. {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Whonix_versus_VPNs
|text=VPNs don't make you anonymous
}} but are often advertised or perceived as anonymity tools by many users. For examples of that, please follow {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Whonix_versus_VPNs#Rationale
|text=this link
}} and press expand on the right side. This criticism is general and not directed at Mullvad, which does not seem to engage in such practices.
** <u>Implied Relationship of VPN Company Sponsoring:</u> If any Linux distribution (such as {{project_name_short}}) would install a browser by default that contains the branding of a VPN company (such as Mullvad Browser), this might lead to users strongly suspecting that the VPN company is paying the Linux distribution for this and as a result might have inappropriate influence over the Linux distributions. This would happen irrespective of whether there actually has been an advertisement deal or not. Disclaimers would only partially help as these might often either not be noticed or regarded as incredible.
** <u>Reputational impact:</u> Any reputation risk or damage is best avoided. Reputational integrity is deemed to be more foundational for the project's success than any technical advantages that any browser might provide.
** <u>Actual impact:</u> While the facts (non-existence of a sponsorship deal, no influence by the VPN company on the Linux distribution) are all positive, avoidance of easily confused and negative impressions is best pursued for pragmatic reasons to avoid jeopardizing the overall success of the project.
** <u>Conclusion:</u> To avoid any confusion, suspicion of having sold out, I have decided not to install any software by default that comes with branding or advertisements from any VPN companies.

== Tor Browser ==
Not an option by default in Kicksecure because it is torified, hence slow. For that use case it would be better to use [[Whonix]]. See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

However, easily installable, opt-in for users of Kicksecure, see [[Tor Browser]].

== Tor Browser without Tor ==
As long as Tor Browser still says "Tor Browser" in the title bar it will be too confusing. Same issue that {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=SecBrowser
|text=SecBrowser
}} had. Related: [[Dev/Default_Browser#In-House_Browser_Development|In-House Browser Development]]

== Base Browser ==
Both, Mullvad Browser (MB) and Tor Browser (TB) are based on Base Browser (BB). However, Base Browser only exists as a source code repository. There are no binary builds available. Base Browser presumably has neither the Mullvad Browser nor Tor Browser branding, which is good. It is not separately maintained as a standalone project by any upstream. Not suitable for the same reasons as documented in chapter [[Dev/Default_Browser#Unbranded_or_Rebranded_Browser|Unbranded or Rebranded Browser]].

Feature Request [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/team/-/issues/28 Maintain a Standalone "Base Browser"] has been rejected.

== Unbranded or Rebranded Browser ==
Unbranded or Rebranded Browser is not a third-party project. It means that the {{project_name_short}} project would take an existing browser such as Mullvad Browser to unbrand or rebrand it.

This is not an option at this time because it is difficult and time-consuming to unbrand, for example, Mullvad Browser, and compile it. The maintenance effort is high and not justified given the current available project resources.

Mozilla Firefox feature request: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1897432 Add an Unbranding Option in Firefox Settings]

related:

* https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Unbranded_Builds
* [[Dev/Default_Browser#In-House_Browser_Development|In-House Browser Development]]

https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/unofficial

== In-House Browser Development ==
Not possible with the current available project resources.

For example, see https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues to see the flood of complex issues that are constantly coming up.

PureOS previously maintained PureBrowser, but it got deprecated due to the too high maintenance effort.

{{quotation
|quote=
There seem to be lots projects out there to “unMozilla” Firefox (removing things like DRM, telemetry, Pocket integration, etc) but it’s getting harder to do that with every Firefox release. That’s what we were up against with PureBrowser and it unfortunately became too daunting of a task (even with tracking ESR like we were). We also wanted to release close to upstream so we had the latest security patches ASAP but again, became unfeasible for our small team.

= Criteria =
Primary importance for Kicksecure must be security. Anti-fingerprinting is nice but secondary. Disabled telemetry can be considered a security feature since it lowers attack surface and a privacy feature. Radio Silence (as defined in LibreWolf feature request [https://codeberg.org/librewolf/issues/issues/1779 Radio Silence by Default for Browser Startup and Background Connections aka "Disable Phone Home" #1779]) would be nice to have.

See also [[Privacy|Privacy Goals and Non-Goals of Kicksecure]].

= Conclusion =
A lot of presumably more secure by default (and better privacy by default) browsers have been considered.

No suitable, well-maintained with timely security upgrades, vendor-neutral, acceptable usability browser project could be found.
