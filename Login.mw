== Login Instructions ==

'''1.''' Type the Username.

* The default username is: <code>user</code>
* Press <code><Enter></code> after typing the username.

'''2.''' Type the Password.

* If a password has been set, type it and press `<Enter>`.
* Note: No feedback (such as asterisks "<code>*</code>") will be shown when typing the password.

== Notes ==

* The default root account is locked for security reasons. For more information, visit the [[root|root account documentation]].
* If you are using a virtual machine, ignore any <code>host login:</code> prompts. Do not enter your host computer username or password.

== Troubleshooting ==

* '''Forgot Username or Password''': If you have forgotten your username or password, please refer to the [[Recovery]] page for steps on recovering your account.
* '''Passwordless Login''' Kicksecure supports passwordless login by default. This means you can log in without entering a password unless one has been set.
