{{intro|
This page provides detailed information about the {{project_name_short}} login screen, how to configure it, and how to log in securely.
}}

= Login Security Concepts =

By default, {{project_name_short}} provides a user account, <code>user</code>, with {{gui}} autologin enabled if applicable, and no password set. When using a system with a GUI, {{project_name_short}} will boot directly into a graphical desktop when powered on. For many users and situations, this configuration is not a security hazard because:

* '''Single-user machines:''' Desktop and laptop systems are generally single-user machines and do not need to authenticate multiple human users. Users of a single-user machine are expected to keep their machine physically secure from in-person attackers.
* '''Multi-user configuration:''' For machines that aren't single-user, the system administrator will generally be the first person to use the machine after installation and will have the opportunity to configure the system's user accounts to meet the needs of all users.
* '''Weak login screen protection:''' The login screen is usually only a weak security barrier. If [[Full Disk Encryption|{{fde}}]]  is not used, a malicious individual can gain access to the machine's data by simply booting a live ISO or stealing the system's storage drive. Even if FDE is used, a sophisticated attacker with sufficient time can likely bypass the login screen if they gain physical access to the device while it is powered on.
* '''FDE makes login screen redundant:''' If using the {{project_name_short}} ISO to install {{project_name_short}} onto a machine, FDE is enabled by default. This requires the user to authenticate before the system will boot, thus making the login screen redundant in most single-user scenarios. Auententcation is done during [[Grub#initramfs_.28initramfs-tools_or_dracut.29_Based_Encryption_Password_Prompt|initramfs (initramfs-tools or dracut) Based Encryption Password Prompt]].
* '''Virtual machines and host security:''' If using {{project_name_short}} in a Virtual Machine, the VM's login security is not as important as the host system's login security. There are numerous ways to modify a virtual machine's state from the host system, allowing an attacker with access to an unlocked host machine to bypass a virtual machine's login screen. Virtual machine users are expected to keep their host system physically secure from in-person attackers.

However, there are situations in which it is valuable to require password authentication for administrative actions or for login purposes. Users should be aware of their [[Threat Modeling|threat model]] and adjust login settings accordingly. Users interested in this topic should read the [[Default_Passwords|Default Passwords]] and [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks|Protection against Physical Attacks]] wiki pages.

Except for desktop HVM Qube, virtual machines in Qubes OS do not use a traditional GUI login mechanism, and thus do not have a concept of GUI autologin.

Host {{os}} versus {{VM}}.

* '''Host operating system:'''
** '''Simple login screen:''' Disabling autologin can be useful if the user wants to enable a login screen.
** '''No full disk encryption:''' Note, the login screen is <u>not</u> providing [[Full_Disk_Encryption|Full Disk Encryption (FDE)]]. The purpose of the login screen is elaborated in chapter [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Login_Screen|Login Screen]].
* '''VMs:''' It is not very useful to disable autologin to enable a login screen inside VMs. It's much more secure to have a login screen on the host operating system.

== Automatic Autologin Configuration ==
To view which user accounts on the system have autologin enabled, run [[systemcheck]]. This will show you a [[Systemcheck#Physical_Security_Check|Physical Security Check]] table, indicating which users on the system are not password protected and/or have autologin enabled.

Only one normal user account can have autologin enabled at once. The reason for this is fairly obvious - if two users had autologin enabled at the same time, which user would be automatically logged into? For this reason, if you enable autologin for one user account when autologin is already enabled for a different user account, autologin will be disabled for that different user account. The only exception to this rule is if [[Sysmaint|user-sysmaint-split]] is installed. In this case, the <code>sysmaint</code> user account can have autologin enabled or disabled independently of the other user accounts. This is because the <code>sysmaint</code> account is only accessible when the system is booted in PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT.

To enable or disable autologin on a user account, you can use the autologinchange utility.

'''1.''' {{sysmaint_notice}}

'''2.''' Launch <code>autologinchange</code>. You can do this by clicking the "Manage GUI Autologin" button in the [[System Maintenance Panel]]. You can also run the tool by running the following command in a terminal:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo autologinchange
}}

'''3.''' autologinchange will display a list of user accounts on the system. Identify the user you want to enable or disable autologin for.

'''4.''' Type the user account's name and press Enter.

'''5.''' You will be told whether autologin is currently enabled or disabled for the current user account. To toggle autologin on the selected account, press <code>y</code>, then press Enter.

'''6.''' Done.

Autologin has now been toggled on the specified user account.

== Manual Autologin Configuration ==

| text    = If you are using {{project_name_short}} 17.3.0.5 or later, you can configure autologin more easily using the automatic autologin configuration instructions above.
}}

To change the auto login behavior, we have to edit the config file of lightdm which is the default display manager used by {{project_name_short}}.

If you use another display manager, please look up in the manual of your display manager on how to change auto login behavior, for lightdm in {{project_name_short}} it is:

Apply the following instructions to enable the login prompt at boot.

This requires configuration of LightDM in {{project_name_short}}.

'''1.''' Disable LightDM autologin.

This is done by deleting the configuration files which enable autologin.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/30_autologin.conf
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo rm /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/40_autologin.conf
}}

'''2.''' Linux user account password.

The user will need to [[Login#Configuring_Passwords|Configuring Passwords]] if one has not already been set.

'''3.''' Reboot.

'''4.''' Done.

Autologin should be disabled after reboot and the user should see a login prompt after reboot.

'''Troubleshooting:''' See footnote for troubleshooting. <ref>
<u>GDM configuration.</u>

GDM is a login manager different from LightDM. Only very old versions of {{project_name_short}} come with GDM installed by default.

'''1.''' Open the GDM configuration file.

Note, if the file is empty that means it doesn't exist. In that case, skip this.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf.dist
}}

'''2.''' Search for the following.

<pre>
AutomaticLoginEnable=true
AutomaticLogin=user
</pre>

'''3.''' Modify.

Out-comment, add a hash symbol ("<code>#</code>") in front of the two lines. Or replace the content, copy/paste the following which does the same.

{{CodeSelect|code=
#AutomaticLoginEnable=true
#AutomaticLogin=user
}}

'''4.''' Save.

'''5.''' {{sysmaint_notice}}

'''6.''' '''<code>sudo</code> password notice.'''

There is no separate <code>sudo</code> password. <code>sudo</code> uses the same password as the user account that is invoking <code>sudo</code>. <ref>
This is the usual Debian / <code>sudo</code> default and [[Unspecific|Unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].
</ref> For example:

* '''user-sysmaint-split:''' Changing the password for account <code>sysmaint</code> will also change the <code>sudo</code> password for account <code>sysmaint</code>.
* '''unrestricted admin mode:''' Changing the password for account <code>user</code> will also change the <code>sudo</code> password, provided the account <code>user</code> is authorized to use <code>sudo</code>.

'''7.''' '''Start <code>pwchange</code>.'''

Open a terminal (such as Xfce Terminal Emulator) or start <code>pwchange</code> using the System Maintenance Panel.

* '''A)''' '''user-sysmaint-split:'''
** '''A 1)''' <u>Using the System Maintenance Panel:</u> You can change user passwords using the <code>Manage Passwords</code> button in the [[System Maintenance Panel]]. The <code>Manage Passwords</code> button will simply start the <code>pwchange</code> utility.
** '''A 2)''' <u>Terminal:</u> Alternatively, you can also change user passwords from a terminal. A terminal can be started using the System Maintenance Panel.
* '''B)''' '''[[Unrestricted admin mode]]:''' Use any method to start any terminal. For example: <code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Terminal</code>

'''8.''' '''Test command.'''

Run a test command with [[root|administrative ("<code>root</code>") rights]] by using <code>sudo</code>.

This is only a simple test to confirm that the user can currently escalate to administrative rights. <ref>
This is to avoid falsely suspecting <code>pwchange</code> as the cause of issues, while in fact the issue lies with <code>sudo</code> authentication.
</ref> Type the following command in the terminal and press <code><Enter></code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo whoami
}}

Expected output.

<pre>
root
</pre>

'''9.''' '''Change a Linux user account password.''' <ref>
* Using [https://github.com/Kicksecure/usability-misc/blob/master/man/pwchange.8.ronn <code>pwchange</code>].
* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/pwchange <code>/usr/sbin/pwchange</code>] source code.
* Alternatively, Debian standard command: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo passwd user
}}

While using <code>passwd</code> and typing the password, it will <u>not</u> appear on the screen, nor will the asterisk sign (<code>*</code>) be visible. This is normal behavior and does not mean your keyboard isn’t working. It is necessary to type blindly and trust the procedure.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo pwchange
}}

<code>pwchange</code> will display a prompt.

<pre>
What user's password do you want to change?
</pre>

Type the account name such as <code>user</code> or <code>sysmaint</code> and then press <code><Enter></code>.

Follow the instructions by <code>pwchange</code>.

'''10.''' '''Root password.'''

No changes required. Optional. For details, see [[Root#Root_Account|root account in {{project_name_short}}]].

'''11.''' '''Done.'''

The procedure of changing passwords is complete.

Another option is to [[Recovery#Recovery_Mode|boot into recovery mode]] and change passwords there.

'''1.''' Type the Username.

* The default username is: <code>user</code>
* Press <code><Enter></code> after typing the username.

'''2.''' Type the Password.

* If a password has been set, type it and press <code><Enter></code>.
* Note: No feedback (such as asterisks "<code>*</code>") will be shown when typing the password.

== Notes ==

* The default root account is locked for security reasons. For more information, visit the [[root|root account documentation]].
* If you are using a virtual machine, ignore any <code>host login:</code> prompts. Do not enter your host computer username or password.

= Troubleshooting =

* '''Forgot Username or Password''': If you have forgotten your username or password, please refer to the [[Recovery]] page for steps on recovering your account.

= Colors =
`Locked (Absent)` for non-sysmaint user = green, that account will not be able to be gotten into without autologin.

`Locked (Absent)` for sysmaint user = orange, because the account can't be gotten into without autologin in a user session, but will be unlocked in a sysmaint session and then will be able to be gotten into even without autologin.

so in most instances, `Locked (Absent)` is the most secure option for an account; the account is locked down, can be accessed via autologin if needed, there's no password to steal or guess.

but for `sysmaint` only, it's a less secure option than `Present`.

red color implies a warning, an issue.

orange color is weaker, implies "kinda issue" similar
