= Live ISO Known Issues =
exercise on separate notebook

use VM to flash for security against data loss

== Failed to mount sysroot.mount - /sysroot. ==
Cosmetic issue only. Details here: https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/iso-error-message-during-boot-mount-sysroot-special-device-liveos-rootfs-does-not-exist/418

== DVD Support ==
[[Untested]]. Should work in theory.

== Dual Boot ==
Disconnect.

== Fastboot ==
Fastboot is a BIOS setting which skips attempting to boot from USB on some computers. In this case, the user must disable Fastboot in order to be able to boot from USB.

== Minor Issues ==
This might be an issue while installing additional packages while running the live ISO. This will not be an issue after installing to hard drive.

Please report a bug if this breaks something for you. Adding a workaround for this would not be difficult.
