{{Intro|
{{project_name_short}} will be a '''complete Operating System'''. '''More developers still wanted!'''

Not available for users yet. Users can either [[Debian|distro-morph Debian into {{project_name_short}}]] or use {{project_name_short}} in a {{VM}} instead, which are available for most major operating systems. If you're looking for '''Live Mode''', see [[Live Mode]]

= Calamares Installer =
== Language Selection ==
The Calamares installer by {{project_name_long}} by design does not ask for keyboard configuration, timezone or language during installation. It is recommended to configure that after the first boot after installation in case this is needed.

== Full Disk Encryption ==
Once you reach the Partition tab:

Partition -> Erase Disk -> Encrypt system

== Encryption Versus Keyboard Layout ==
The installer will encrypt <code>/boot</code> but with US keyboard. This can be confusing. The user might type the password in their local keyboard layout while GRUB is interpreting the password using USA keyboard layout.

* US: This is a non-issue for users using US keyboards.
* non-US: This issue exists.

Which workarounds are available to users?

Realistic:

* '''A)''' Use a separate US keyboard;
* '''B)''' Avoid characters which are different on your local vs the US keyboard layout;
* '''C)''' Use a different installation method, [[Debian|Distribution morphing]];
* '''D)''' Not using full disk encryption. Not recommended.;

Less realistic, for developers only:

* '''F)''' Workaround the bug by patching Kicksecure Calamares installer to use unencrpyted /boot;
* '''G)''' Fix the GRUB bug.

=== Solution in the Future ===
Perhaps add an info screen about keyboard layout issue?

=== Tickets ===
* installer, Calamares bug report [https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1203 Encryption does not work well with non-QWERTY keyboards]
* Debian feature request: [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=686817 grub-pc: Add option to change keyboard layout]
* bootloader, GNU grub feature request: [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?65113 Add All Keyboard Layouts and Selector to Early GRUB Core Image (grubx64.efi)]

= Live ISO Known Issues =
== Minor Issues ==
This might be an issue while installing additional packages while running the live ISO. This will not be an issue after installing to hard drive.

Please report a bug if this breaks something for you. Adding a workaround for this would not be difficult.
