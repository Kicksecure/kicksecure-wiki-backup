* In this process you will use a software tool to create a {{project_name_short}} Live USB by writing our ISO onto this USB stick.
* This procedure is similar for ALL Linux distribution which provide a Live USB stick for installation. The procedure is therefore [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].

* '''Target device deletion''': Be aware that the process will completely erase everything on the USB drive you use - absolutely all data. It's important to understand that once you start this process, there's no going back, and anything on that USB drive will be permanently lost.
* '''Backup''': Before you start, please make sure you save copies of anything important on your computer. This includes all documents, photos, movies, and save games, ensuring they are securely backed up. That way, if something goes wrong, you won't lose anything valuable. It's not just the USB drive you should worry about; you need to back up your entire computer, just in case. This is because if you accidentally select the wrong device - like your computer's internal hard drive instead of the USB drive - all the data on your computer could be erased. See also [[Backup]]. Skip this step only at your own risk.
* '''Restoration test''': After making your backup, check to see if you can actually open and use those files. This is to make sure your backup really works. It's important to verify that the backup is successful and that your important files are safe and accessible, should you need to restore them later.
* '''Unplug Non-Essential devices and drives''': To minimize risk, unplug any non-essential external drives or devices that could be misidentified as a target for flashing.

* <u>Context:</u> Currently using a Qubes VM such as for example a Qubes VM running Debian or another Linux? Attempting to flash the {{project_name_short}} ISO to USB? If you can answer both questions with yes, this wiki tab is for you.
* <u>What this is not:</u> This is not about a {{project_name_short}} Template. For that, go to [[Qubes|{{project_name_short}} for Qubes]].
* <u>Prior USB storage device usage in Qubes:</u> Having used USB storage devices in Qubes before. This is important because there are many issues with Qubes and USB devices. General issues with be [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] and should not be mixed when attempting something slightly more complex such as flashing an operating system to USB.
* <u>Appropriate choice:</u> Properly using a Qubes App Qube to flash a USB drive when following this documentation should have a very low disk of data loss. The usual advice about the importance of backups and a tested backup restoration process of course always applies unrelated to this documentation.
* <u>Choice of method:</u> Choose either Command Line Image Writer <u>or</u> a Graphical Image Writer. Not both.
* <u>Connect only 1 USB device to the App Qube:</u> To guard against data loss, it is recommended and much simpler to only connect 1 USB device to the App Qube to be used for flashing the {{project_name_short}} ISO.
* <u>Usage of examples in documentation:</u> The following documentation uses the files which represent physical devices <code>/dev/xvdi</code> (or <code>/dev/sda</code>) as example devices. These instructions were tested inside a Debian based App Qube on Qubes R4.2. In theory, in later Qubes versions these files might represent other devices. If only 1 USB devices is connected to the App Qube and if only using that App Qube for flashing, the risk of data loss should on other USB devices should be very low. And of course, data in other App Qubes would be secure as usual thanks to Qubes compartmentalization.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-3 cs-yellow}} Now you're ready to process with the next step

'''{{Icon|fa-solid fa-5 cs-blue}} Power on your computer. As soon as it starts booting press you Boot Menu Key several times (twice per second should be enough)'''

This should open the Boot Menu after pressing the key for a couple of seconds. The figure below shows an example of a Boot Menu. The look of different boot menus can vary strongly between vendors. But in principle (1) it says "Boot Menu" and (2) gives you different options to choose from.

'''{{Icon|fa-solid fa-6 cs-blue}} Try out all the Boot Menu key "candidates"'''

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-1 cs-yellow}} If the computer starts on another operating system (meaning NOT {{project_name_short}}) or returns an error message, shut down the computer again and repeat step 5 for all the possible Boot Menu key "candidates" identified in step 3.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-2 cs-yellow}} If you have no luck with any of the Boot Menu key "candidates" or if you enter a menu called "BIOS" then you need to go back to step 4.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-3 cs-yellow}} If a Boot Menu with a list of devices appears, that's correct. Now select your USB stick (in the example image "Removable Devices", but the name can vary) and press Enter.

'''{{Icon|fa-solid fa-7 cs-blue}} GRUB Boot Loader Step'''

If the computer starts on {{project_name_short}} ISO, the GRUB Boot Loader will appear giving boot options. You can read the instructions or just sit back. After some seconds, it will automatically boot the ISO.
