{{Intro|

= Calamares Installer =
== Language Selection ==
The Calamares installer does not ask for keyboard configuration, timezone or language during installation. It is recommended to configure that after the first boot after installation in case this is needed.

== Full Disk Encryption ==
Once you reach the Partition tab:

Partition -> Erase Disk -> Encrypt system

== Encryption Versus Keyboard Layout ==
The installer will encrypt <code>/boot</code> but with US keyboard. This can be confusing. The user might type the password in their local keyboard layout while GRUB is interpreting the password using USA keyboard layout.

* installer, Calamares bug report [https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1203 Encryption does not work well with non-QWERTY keyboards]
* Debian feature request: [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=686817 grub-pc: Add option to change keyboard layout]
* bootloader, GNU grub feature request: [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?65113 Add All Keyboard Layouts and Selector to Early GRUB Core Image (grubx64.efi)]

= Live ISO Known Issues =
== Minor Issues ==
This might be an issue while installing additional packages while running the live ISO. This will not be an issue after installing to hard drive.

Please report a bug if this breaks something for you. Adding a workaround for this would not be difficult.
