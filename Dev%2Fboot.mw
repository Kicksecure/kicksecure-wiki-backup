= GRUB =
== grub-install command responsibility ==

Who should run the <code>grub-install</code> command? SystemBuildTools or Debian package maintainer scripts?

As it is currently designed, it seems [https://wiki.debian.org/SystemBuildTools SystemBuildTools] are supposed to execute the <code>grub-install</code> command.

<code>calamares</code> installer runs <code>grub-install</code>. <code>live-build</code> has extensive code to set up GRUB and other bootloaders. <code>mkosi</code> uses <code>grub-mkimage</code>.

It's the system build tool that is responsible for setting up the bootloader, which requires running bootloader installation commands.

}}

== Core Bootloader Packages ==
Kicksecure uses different metapackages to provide the bootloader for different systems. grub-cloud is used on Kicksecure VMs, while grub-efi and grub-pc-bin are used by the ISO.

=== grub-cloud package ===

}}

<code>grub-cloud-amd64</code> package and <code>/etc/default/grub</code> file inclusion:

<u>Non-issue:</u> <code>grub-cloud</code>, while it has "cloud" in its name, and while it may be suitable for installation on cloud servers, has no additional networking or cloud features not found in "standard" GRUB packages. <code>grub-cloud</code> does not "interact with the cloud". It does not boot from the cloud or have other problematic cloud features. Such features are not planned either. Its source code is minimal and consists only of Debian packaging files and a <code>/etc/default/grub</code> configuration file. The <code>grub-cloud</code> package is a workaround for the lack of <code>grub-pc</code> and <code>grub-efi</code> co-installability, a workaround for Debian bug [https://bugs-devel.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904062 grub-efi-amd64: Allow concurrent installation of grub-pc and grub-efi-amd64].

GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 consoleblank=0"
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="gfxterm serial"
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200"
</pre>

* Potential issues with <code>grub-cloud</code> managing <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:
** Running <code>debsums --changed --config</code> would list <code>/etc/default/grub</code> as a changed configuration file.
** Setting <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 consoleblank=0"</code> can cause issues:
*** Security concerns?
*** Systemd log spam inside VirtualBox:

<pre>
serial-getty@ttyS0.service: Succeeded.
serial-getty@ttyS0.service: Service RestartSec=100ms expired, scheduling restart.
serial-getty@ttyS0.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 625.

Stopped Serial Getty on ttyS0.
Started Serial Getty on ttyS0.
/dev/ttyS0: not a tty
</pre>

* VirtualBox: Adding a virtual disconnected serial console does not help either. This causes:
** GRUB boot menu becoming invisible.
** No console output for a long time.
** Extremely slow boot times.

The serial console-related issues were encountered ~5 years ago when considering "why not enable a serial console by default inside VM images."

* Possible solution: If using a <code>grub-cloud</code>-based solution, it may be better to undo the serial console setup.
* Architectural limitations: <code>grub-cloud</code> currently supports only a limited set of architectures (Intel/AMD64 and ARM64 at the time of writing). Depending on your plans for multi-architecture support (as Debian is the universal operating system), this may be a limitation.

== Bootloader-related Kicksecure and Whonix packages ==
The following packages directly affect the bootloader or bootloader configuration used by Kicksecure.

=== live-config-dist ===
* Purpose: Used to provide installer and live ISO configuration.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Sets the distro name and version shown on the boot menu of the live ISO.
** Ensures a menu entry for accessing UEFI firmware settings is added to the live ISO.
** Ensures the GRUB fallback bootloader is properly installed.
** Assists with initial bootloader installation on machines installed from the ISO.

=== dist-base-files ===
* Provides base configuration used by both Kicksecure and Whonix.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Provides customized versions of the grub-mkconfig scripts in order to reorganize the bootloader menu so that normal boot modes appear at the top, and "Advanced options" boot modes appear at the bottom.
** Provides common files for the Kicksecure and Whonix GRUB themes.
** For VM images (not ISO-installed systems), overrides non-ideal GRUB bootloader settings from grub-cloud, putting the kernel in quiet mode and disabling the serial console.

=== grub-live ===
* Provides a live boot mode. Changes made to the root filesystem in this mode are ephemeral and will be lost on reboot.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Adds entries to the boot menu for booting in live mode.
** Adds additional debugging info to the output of grub-mkconfig.

=== serial-console-enable ===
* Adds a TTY that can be accessed via the serial console.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Enables GRUB bootloader serial console output.
** Adds kernel parameters to the Linux kernel command line to enable a TTY on the serial console.

=== security-misc ===
* Enables a plethora of hardening features to increase the security of Kicksecure and Whonix.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Enables strong CPU vulnerability mitigations via the kernel command line.
** Enables several general kernel hardening features via the kernel command line.
** Puts the kernel into quiet logging mode via kernel parameters to avoid leaking sensitive info on the console during boot.
** Disables Dracut-based recovery features via kernel parameters to make it more difficult to get a root shell improperly.

=== usability-misc ===
* Provides miscellaneous usability improvements for Kicksecure.
* Effects on bootloader: Sets the default display resolution during early boot to 1024x768. (Note that this is NOT a hard limit; the end-user can set their resolution to whatever they want once the system is booted.)

=== debug-misc ===
* Enables a wide variety of debugging features. Not installed by default and should NOT be installed on systems where security is a concern.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Removes kernel parameters that would otherwise disable message printing on the console during early boot.
** Enables verbose debugging output in initramfs-tools, dracut, systemd, and the Linux kernel via kernel parameters.
** Disables SELinux enforcement via a kernel parameter. Kicksecure itself doesn't use SELinux by default, but debug-misc may be used on some other distro or a user might enable SELinux later, which could interfere with debugging.

=== kicksecure-base-files ===
* Provides base configuration specific to Kicksecure.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Sets the distro name shown on the boot menu of installed systems.
** Provides the Kicksecure-specific components of the GRUB theme.
** Sets the GRUB theme in GRUB itself.
** Sets the screen resolution for the GRUB menu to 1280x720 on EFI systems, and 1024x768 on BIOS systems.

=== user-sysmaint-split ===
* Prevents standard user accounts from using privilege escalation tools to obtain root and provides a special sysmaint boot mode in which root access can be obtained.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Adds a boot entry for booting into sysmaint mode.
** Adds a boot entry for uninstalling user-sysmaint-split quickly and with minimal effort.

=== whonix-base-files ===
* Whonix-only. Provides base configuration specific to Whonix.
* Effects on bootloader: Sets the distro name shown on the boot menu of installed systems to a generic "Whonix" value. This is usually overridden by one of anon-ws-base-files or anon-gw-base-files.

=== anon-ws-base-files ===
* Whonix-only. Provides base configuration specific to Whonix-Workstation.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Sets the distro name shown on the boot menu of installed systems.
** Provides the Whonix-Workstation-specific components of the GRUB theme.
** Sets the GRUB theme in GRUB itself.
** Sets the screen resolution for the GRUB menu to 1280x720 on EFI systems, and 1024x768 on BIOS systems.

=== anon-gw-base-files ===
* Whonix-only. Provides base configuration specific to Whonix-Gateway.
* Effects on bootloader:
** Sets the distro name shown on the boot menu of installed systems.
** Provides the Whonix-Gateway-specific components of the GRUB theme.
** Sets the GRUB theme in GRUB itself.
** Sets the screen resolution for the GRUB menu to 1280x720 on EFI systems, and 1024x768 on BIOS systems.

== Live ISO GRUB configuration ==
derivative-maker sets a custom GRUB configuration for Kicksecure live ISOs. This configuration is stored under [https://github.com/derivative-maker/derivative-maker/tree/master/live-build-data/grub-config derivative-maker/live-build-data/grub-config]. The files in this directory are enumerated below, along with the job each one performs.

* config.cfg
** Provides base GRUB config setup. Loads fonts, video drivers, and the theme for GRUB, among other things.
* grub.cfg
** Template configuration file into which live-build inserts boot menu information. Provides menu entries for live boot, debian-installer (if applicable - currently this is not applicable to Kicksecure's ISOs), and launchers for utilities like memtest, firmware setup, and boot media checksumming.
* install_gui.cfg
** Only applicable when debian-installer is enabled (currently it is not for Kicksecure). Provides boot modes that launch either the GUI or text-mode Debian installer when debian-installer is enabled and GUI mode is selected.
* install_start_gui.cfg
** Vestigial, copied from the base live GRUB config in live-build. Unused by Kicksecure even if debian-installer is enabled.
* install_start_text.cfg
** Vestigial, copied from the base live GRUB config in live-build. Unused by Kicksecure even if debian-installer is enabled.
* install_text.cfg
** Only applicable when debian-installer is enabled (currently it is not for Kicksecure). Provides boot modes that launch the text-mode Debian installer when debian-installer is enabled and GUI mode is disabled.
* memtest.cfg
** Provides boot modes for launching Memtest86+.
* splash.svg
** Provides the background image for the GRUB splash screen used on the live ISO.
* theme.cfg
** Loads the GRUB theme from live-theme/theme.txt. Also provides a fallback default theme if this fails for some reason.
* live-theme/theme.txt
** Provides dynamic parts of the GRUB theme. Specifies the colors and positions of UI elements, and includes a progress bar indicating how much time the user has to react before GRUB automatically boots the first boot mode listed in the ISO's boot menu.

== GRUB Full Disk Encryption ==
{{quotation
|quote=Kicksecure doesn’t use GRUB to unlock encrypted disks. This is because we use Debian’s GRUB, and Debian’s GRUB only has very bad LUKS support (only supports LUKS1, can’t handle non-US keyboard layouts, ugly, slow, only gives you one shot to unlock the drive, and then the Linux kernel has to unlock the drive again once it boots). Instead, we use an unencrypted /boot partition and let the initramfs handle decrypt. This lets us use more secure encryption, provides a better user interface for decryption, works with multiple keyboard layouts, and works faster.

== /etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg ==

File {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
/etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg
}} is used to undo the opinionated default configuration set by the Debian package [[Dev/boot#grub-cloud_package|grub-cloud package]].

Why is the folder <code>/usr/share/derivative-base-files</code> used? Why is the file copied using derivative-maker during the build process? Why not simply ship the file as <code>/etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg</code> as part of package <code>dist-base-files</code>? Because it is not applicable to all image creation and installation methods. This should only be done when building a VM image that uses grub-cloud (which is utilized by <code>grml-debootstrap</code>).

<u>VM images:</u>

File [https://github.com/Kicksecure/dist-base-files/blob/master/usr/share/derivative-base-files/20_dist-base-files.cfg <code>/usr/share/derivative-base-files/20_dist-base-files.cfg</code>] is copied by derivative-maker during the build process to <code>/etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg</code>.

<u>Kicksecure's ISO:</u>

The ISO does not need <code>/etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg</code> because it does not use <code>grub-cloud</code>. (The ISO is build using <code>live-build</code>, not <code>grml-debootstrap</code>.)

<u>Calamares:</u>

The installer used by Kicksecure's ISO, Calamares, edits the file <code>/etc/default/grub</code> by adding <code>rd.luks.uuid</code> to <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code>. For example:

<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet rd.luks.uuid=dc1f531b-eea8-47b0-86f2-a841d6d61a4e'
</pre>

If the file <code>/etc/default/grub.d/20_dist-base-files.cfg</code> were shipped unconditionally, it might break the boot process.

== ARM - Generally ==
The situation used to be, and for the most part still is, as follows:

* Each SBC (single-board computer) usually has a different boot process.
* Most SBCs require either Debian forks or Armbian.
* There was a Snapdragon X Elite dev board with EFI boot support, so standard Debian could in theory be run. No bootloader/image modifications required. However, the Snapdragon X Elite dev board was deprecated upstream. In any case, it likely would have had poor or no Linux support initially.

The current situation may improve in the future, thanks to:

* Arm SystemReady Compliance Program
* Arm Base Boot Requirements (BBR)
* Arm Base Boot Security Requirements (BBSR)
* In the future, it might be useful to look for terminology such as "SystemReady IR compliant UEFI BIOS".

This is only theoretical research.

Instead of ARM64, Intel/AMD64 (sometimes referred to as x86) Mini-PCs might be a viable alternative, as these nowadays come with UEFI support by default, thus avoiding bootloader issues.

Bootloader issues aside, whether Intel/AMD64 or ARM64, Linux/Debian support must always be verified before purchase.

== Raspberry Pi - RPi ==
=== Bootloader Information - RPi ===
==== RPi Bootloader ====

The RPi has its own custom boot protocol, using an internal bootloader in the Broadcom GPU.

* [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-boot-eeprom Raspberry Pi boot EEPROM]
* [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#bootloader_update_stable Update the bootloader]

Debian images use direct kernel boot via that bootloader.

This repository contains the scripts and pre-compiled binaries used to create the <code>rpi-eeprom</code> package, which is used to update the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 bootloader EEPROM images.
|context=[https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom rpi-eeprom on GitHub]
}}

That boot protocol simply loads an {{os}} from a fixed location. The OS can be u-boot, UEFI EDK2, Linux, or anything else compatible.

The RPi bootloader can be configured using [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code>].

The RPi bootloader is not the same as u-boot, but it can chainload u-boot.

==== u-boot on RPi ====
* u-boot is not a strict requirement to boot RPi. It is possible to boot RPi without u-boot.
* It might be preferable to hide u-boot from the user to avoid the need for manual configuration, due to relatively low familiarity compared to GRUB.
* u-boot is likely required to enable (chainload) GRUB.

Installation

The raspberry pi targets can be installed by copying u-boot.bin to the
FAT partition of the raspberry pi boot firmware:

  mkdir -p /boot/fat
  mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot/fat
  cp -vb /usr/lib/u-boot/TARGET/u-boot.bin /boot/fat/

Then specify the u-boot.bin as the kernel to load in config.txt on the
FAT partition:

  kernel u-boot.bin

It should then support booting off of MMC and USB devices with serial
console or HDMI with USB keyboard.

}}

* [https://docs.u-boot.org/en/stable/develop/uefi/uefi.html u-boot has UEFI-alike functionality] that can be used to chainload grub-efi
** TODO: Is this enabled by default in Debian? Probably yes.
*** File: <code>configs/rpi_defconfig</code>

<pre>
CONFIG_EFI_LOADER=y
</pre>

==== GRUB ====
===== Rationale for using GRUB on RPi =====
* Using GRUB may be desirable because standard Debian kernel upgrades will work out-of-the-box.
* A familiar boot menu, kernel parameter editing, and configuration interface can be used.

===== grub-uboot on RPi =====
[https://packages.debian.org/grub-uboot grub-uboot] is available only for the architectures <code>armel</code> and <code>armhf</code>. Therefore, it is not usable on RPi 4 and RPi 5, which are <code>arm64</code>.

There are few public discussions on using <code>grub-uboot</code>. Related: [https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?t=26894 ODROID forum: HOWTO - Using GRUB as bootloader (second stage after U-Boot)]

{{quotation
|quote=
GRUB actually has an arm-uboot backend for 32-bit ARM.
There are two problems with this, apart from not being
implemented for arm64: 1) GRUB hardcodes the physical
address of RAM, making the binary somewhat SoC-specific. 2)
It relies on an optional API feature of U-Boot, which is
disabled by default, therefore not build-tested for most targets
and appeared to be in poor shape. A UEFI implementation
could leverage U-Boot drivers, while allowing to boot a
generic GRUB binary.
|context=PDF: https://www.bsdforen.de/attachments/uefi-on-top-of-u-boot-pdf.4528/
}}

===== grub-pc on RPi =====
Is it possible to (chainload) use [https://packages.debian.org/grub-pc grub-pc]? No, generally not, because <code>grub-pc</code> is for the <code>i386</code> architecture only.

==== Secure Boot on RPi ====
While RPi upstream does not support UEFI, RPi does support non-UEFI Secure Boot according to:

* https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-app-notes-guides-whitepapers/documents/RP-003466-WP/Boot-Security-Howto.pdf
* https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot#secure-boot

==== UEFI on RPi ====
* No EFI support by upstream RPi.
* Community firmware: [https://github.com/pftf/RPi4 EDK2 Raspberry Pi 4 UEFI firmware]
* No commits in 2 months as of April 2025, with unmerged important-sounding pull requests:
** https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/pull/274
** This implies it may be broken by upstream changes.

=== Debian Support - Raspberry Pi 5 ===
Regarding "real", original Debian (from debian.org) support for RPi 5:

{{quotation
|quote=/!\ Currently there is no support to Raspberry Pi 5 as it doesn't have enough support in upstream Linux.
|context=[https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPiImages RaspberryPiImages - Debian Wiki] (April 2025)
}}

RPi 5 might be supported by Raspberry Pi OS, Armbian, or Ubuntu, but that is of less interest in the context of {{project_name_short}}. "Real" Debian support is required. Related: [[Dev/Operating_System#Original_Base_Distributions_Only|Original Base Distributions Only]]

=== Boot Process Design - RPi ===
* GRUB should be the "main" bootloader from the user's perspective.
* The advantage is that kernel upgrades will be functional, with no manual user action required.
* Kernel parameters set by [[security-misc]], [[grub-live]], [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split]] would likely work out-of-the-box.
* Even [[Release Upgrade]]s should be possible.
* u-boot should be treated as part of the firmware and should not require updates or user interaction.
* The operating system should be fully contained either on the SD card or on the USB drive.
* Universal ARM64 images should be bootable on:
** Standard (non-RPi) ARM64 hardware
** RPi non-UEFI
** RPi UEFI
