* System boot process
* Network connectivity
* Graphical desktop environment
* APT package management
* Necessity for manual interventions or fixes

Furthermore, each stable version of {{project_name_short}} should support seamless upgrades to the subsequent stable release, typically within a month after the new version becomes available.
