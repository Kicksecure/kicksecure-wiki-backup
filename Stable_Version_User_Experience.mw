User Experience Goals for the Stable Version of {{project_name_long}}
}}
Goal: Using stable version of {{project_name_long}} should never run into situations/upgrades that destroy:

* boot
* connectivity
* graphical desktop
* APT
* or require manual fixes being applied.

Each stable version should be able to upgrade to the next stable version, at least within a month or so.
