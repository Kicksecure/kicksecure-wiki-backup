{{intro|
It is possible for [[Malware and Firmware Trojans|malware]] to masquerade as a login prompt in order to steal login passwords. This page documents this advanced threat model and how to prevent malware from sniffing the root password using [[SysRq|<code>SysRq</code>]] + <code>r</code>. (<code>unraw</code>)
}}
= Introduction =
This attack assumes an advanced [[Threat Modeling|threat model]]:

{{IconSet|h1|1}} A system is configured with a limited account (for example "<code>user</code>") that uses a graphical display server session (such as X11 or Wayland) which is separate from the account with administrative ([[root|<code>root</code>]]/<code>sudo</code>) permissions (for example "<code>[[sysmaint|sysmaint]]</code>").

{{IconSet|h1|2}} The limited account is compromised at some point by [[Malware and Firmware Trojans|malware]].

Or:

{{IconSet|h2|1}} Multiple non-root accounts share the same computer and use different [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]].

{{IconSet|h2|2}} A compromised or malicious account could pretend to have logged out of the virtual console, but actually started a spoofed login screen.

<u>Note</u>: If there is only one account that also has administrative (<code>root</code>/<code>sudo</code>) access, malware can [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|sniff the administrative password]] and an advanced login spoofing attack is unnecessary.

= Security Benefit of Compartmentalization =

Under many threat models, the compromise of the limited account is considered catastrophic, since running malware:

* <u>Full access to user data:</u> Malware has full access to all user-accessible files.
* <u>Credential and session capture:</u> Malware can view all keyboard inputs and take over login sessions.
* <u>Screen deception:</u> Malware may present false information on the screen.
* <u>Additional malicious actions:</u> Malware can perform other malicious actions, see: [[Malware and Firmware Trojans#The_Importance_of_a_Malware_Free_System|The Importance of a Malware-Free System]].

However, if multiple (virtual) machines are used for compartmentalization, the harmful impact of malware might not be catastrophic. For instance, other goals of this configuration include prevention of root compromise to help protect the virtualizer and avoid host compromise, and similarly to avoid hardware compromise. This is further elaborated in the rationale section of the [[Root#Rationale|Safely Use Root Commands]] wiki chapter.

A broken graphical system (X11 or Wayland) can block switching to a virtual console. It logically follows that malware which has compromised the graphical system can also perform this action. In this case, the <code>SysRq</code> + <code>r</code> combination can take control away from the graphical system. <ref>
This is because the Linux kernel removes control of the graphical system from the console. The Linux kernel has higher privileges than the display server.
</ref> This is a safer procedure; otherwise, a compromised graphical system could simulate a virtual console login prompt in order to sniff an account login password with root access. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_spoofing login spoofing in Wikipedia]).

<code>SysRq</code> + <code>k</code> (Secure Access Key) can be used to defeat login spoofing because it will terminate all programs on that [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual console]].

[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/sysrq.html#okay-so-what-can-i-use-them-for Quote Linux Kernel Documentation]:

<blockquote>Sak (Secure Access Key) is useful when you want to be sure there is no trojan program running at console which could grab your password when you would try to login. It will kill all programs on the given console, thus letting you make sure that the login prompt you see is actually the one from init, not some trojan program.</blockquote>

[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt Quote Linux Kernel Secure Attention Key Documentation]:

<blockquote>An operating system's Secure Attention Key is a security tool which is provided as protection against trojan password capturing programs. It is an undefeatable way of killing all programs which could be masquerading as login applications. Users need to be taught to enter this key sequence before they log in to the system.</blockquote>

Even if using Wayland as a replacement for the X11:

* <u>Secure Access Key still required:</u> Secure Access Key will still be required.
* <u>Potential KVM VM issues:</u> Issues with KVM VMs: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/issues/3930 Graphical corruption and related issues with virtio graphics (no virgl)].

Taking steps to defeat login spoofing probably only makes sense when also performing actions to [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]].

The SysRq Key is disabled in {{project_name_short}} by default for security reasons. See [[SysRq|System Recovery using SysRq Key]] on how to enable it.
