= Introduction =
On offline systems it makes sense to disable [[sdwdate]] and [[Boot Clock Randomization]] since it's not needed in offline VMs and can interfere with [[Two-factor authentication 2FA|Two-factor Authentication (2FA)]] code generators. <ref>
Could interfere with TOTP (time-based one-time password) based 2FA code generators.
</ref>

= Instructions =
