{{project_name_long}} can be downloaded over TLS (formerly SSL) and/or an onion service. Note that the [[SSL|TLS]] certificate authority (CA) system is seriously flawed and poses the risk of security breaches, therefore it should be avoided if possible.

As documented on the [[Verify the virtual machine images|Verify {{project_name_long}} Images]] page, OpenPGP verification is far safer and strongly recommended as an alternative to plain TLS.

The most secure method of obtaining {{project_name_long}} is to build it from source code. In this way, it is unnecessary to [[Trust|trust]] that developers have actually created [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds binaries which match the source code]. For utmost security, the source code can be reviewed beforehand.
