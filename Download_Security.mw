= Introduction =
{{project_name_long}} can be downloaded over TLS (formerly SSL) and/or an onion service. Note that the [[SSL|TLS]] certificate authority (CA) system is seriously flawed and poses the risk of security breaches, therefore it should be avoided if possible.

As documented on the [[Verify the images|Verify {{project_name_short}} Images]] page, OpenPGP verification is far safer and strongly recommended as an alternative to plain TLS.

The most secure method of obtaining {{project_name_short}} is to build it from source code. In this way, it is unnecessary to [[Trust|trust]] that developers have actually created [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds binaries which match the source code]. For utmost security, the source code can be reviewed beforehand.

== For Windows Host Operating Systems ==
balenaEtcher has the best usability. There are no extraneous options that easily confuse users. However, balenaEtcher comes with issues.

|quote=For Windows and macOS, we instruct people to use balenaEtcher to copy the USB image onto their USB stick. On top of this, we self-host the downloads of balenaEtcher on our own infrastructure. The https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/etcher-binary repository is added as an ikiwiki underlay on our website.

We self-host a copy of balenaEtcher because:

* It gives us more predictability on what users end up doing. This is useful in terms of Help Desk.
* It prevents 3rd parties from learning a bit more about who uses Tails. Pointing to GitHub from our website would provide direct referrers to GitHub (and maybe Balena too) about who is using balenaEtcher to install Tails.
* It prevents GitHub from serving rogue downloads (targeted or not). We might still get a rogue download ourselves but:
** We download balenaEtcher several times from different locations to prevent targeted attacks.
** We download balenaEtcher in a limited time window, which might save our users some supply chain issues. If our users were to download balenaEtcher every time, a short-time supply chain attack would definitely affect some of them.

|quote=Etcher is an Electron app, i.e. essentially a glorified webapp wrapped
in a window; this is a rather common way to build a cross-platform app
these days. It’s GUI is made of HTML + JS. Some of it is shipped in the
app itself, some of it is dynamically fetched from balena.io at run
time. So we clearly can’t even try to protect against “Balena knows that
someone is using Etcher from $IP”. I did not check whether the web
content retrieved at run time can inject arbitrary JS which could itself
include tracking code.

The <code>analytics</code> modules fetches its config over plaintext HTTP (and is
then redirected to HTTPS but that’s too late). It uses mixpanel.com. I’m
not sure I understood the code correctly but at first glance it seems
that at least errors (and possibly more) will be reported there. So
basically, an active MitM could have users report to an URL chosen by
the attacker. “Interesting”.

Some of the outgoing HTTP requests include the Etcher version as a
parameter. External modules, which I did not inspect, are used to
perform HTTP requests.
The ads seem to be fetched from
https://assets.balena.io/etcher-featured/index.html. I did not try to
decipher the obfuscated/minified JS found there but at the very least,
it seems to report to Google Analytics.
I’m stopping here. tl;dr is: Etcher is definitely not behaving as one
would expect a privacy-friendly local app would. It’s behaving more like
any random modern website, including all kinds of tracking technologies.
Fixing this would require major changes so that’s unlikely to happen.
It’s non-trivial to check whether the code reports to Balena or random
third parties (such as Google, Mixpanel) what image is being installed;
and even if we did this audit work now, our results would be invalidated
by every new Etcher release. So it seems we have two options:

|quote=After adding MitM to my packet sniffing I can confirm gameindustry's findings that balenaEtcher exfiltrates very sensitive information. For instance, the filename of the image will let Balena know that the user is flashing Tails, full details: [https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/uploads/2bdaec1725d89ededc786212ee768bd3/exfil.json exfil.json]. It also exfiltrates tons of information about the host system to sentry.io, an "app monitoring service", definitely making it uniquely identifiable.
Disabling the telemetry in its configuration indeed does stop it from exfiltrating the <code>exfil.json</code> from above, but it doesn't do anything about the data sent to sentry.io, which includes the image name, so there is no way to configure balenaEtcher to not leak that Tails is being flashed.
The good UX of balenaEtcher is not worth this.
|context=[https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/16381 anonym, Tails developer]
}}

The issue of Telemetry is known by balena, the developer of etcher as per github issues [https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/3784 Telemtery should be opt-in], [https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/2977 Etcher secretly spies on the user without consent.] balena however closed the tickets and no changes have been made.

This has resulted in bad press for Tails.

|quote=Author's note

What I wonder about, in the context of Tails, an operating system focused on privacy and security, is why the providers of the Tails Foundation suggest BalenaEtcher as the primary program for creating images of the operating system on their own website. It is absolutely incomprehensible and not only negligent but also contradicts any understanding of security and data privacy.

The Tails Foundation has been contacted in this regard and has been approached for comment.

* https://forum.torproject.org/t/nature-of-etcher-portable-is-it-safe-a-current-version-doesn-t-start-right/9233

Therefore {{project_name_short}} [[ISO]] installation instructions do not use balenaEtcher and instead suggest using [https://apps.kde.org/en-gb/isoimagewriter/ KDE ISO Image Writer]. The KDE project is huge, has a long, positive history. It does not have a history of privacy intrusions. No negative information about KDE ISO Image Writer could be found.

* [[Windows Hosts]]

== For MacOS Host Operating Systems ==
USBImager is suggested because KDE ISO Image Writer is unavailable for MacOS. Not maintained by a huge project but also no negative information about KDE ISO Image Writer could be found.

* [[MacOS Hosts]]

== For Linux Host Operating Systems ==
GNOME Disks is suggested. Usability isn't as good. The interface is more complicated to use for users. GNOME is also a huge project and no negative information about GNOME Disks could be found. GNOME Disks is available from official Debian and many other Linux distribution's package sources, which simplifies its installation and no manual digital software signatures verification is requires since this is usually handled by the distribution's package manager.

== Self-Hosting vs Third Party Hosting ==
Self-hosting of image writer tools on the {{project_name_short}} server advantages:

* Better user privacy in theory, in practice, see also [[Trust#Server_Privacy|Server Privacy]].

Self-hosting of image writer tools on the {{project_name_short}} server disadvantages:

* Higher maintenance effort of download, digital software signature verification (if available), upload of ISO image writing tool
* Reputational risk in case of issues with the ISO image writing tool (such as Telemetry or other [[Malware]]).
* Expand the project's scope, distracting from higher priority development tasks.

Therefore it has been decided not to expand the project's scope to include this activity.

See also [[Trust#Self-Hosting_vs_Third_Party_Hosting|Self-Hosting vs Third Party Hosting]].

== Digital Software Signature Verification ==
Tools for software digital signature verification are not installed by default on the Windows (and macOS?) platform. These could be manually installed but there is a bootstrap issue. These tools itself would have to be downloaded over https, i.e. only with a very basic form of authentication. In contrast, on the Linux platform usually the GnuPG software digital signature verification tool is installed by default.
