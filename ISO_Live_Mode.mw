{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be booted in ISO Live Mode.'''

ISO Live Mode is like using a temporary computer session. Nothing you do is saved after you shut it down. It’s similar to using private or incognito mode in a browser, but for the entire operating system.

This mode is useful for trying out {{project_name_short}} without making permanent changes. It helps preserve privacy and security, as all data, files, and settings are discarded on shutdown. It’s also helpful for testing the system before installation.
}}

When booting from the [[ISO]], the system will always default to ISO live mode, meaning changes will not be saved.

After booting from the ISO, the user can [[ISO|install {{project_name_long}} to a hard drive]] or [[USB Installation|install it on another USB drive]]. After installation, the user can choose between [[Persistent Mode]] and ([[grub-live]]) [[Live Mode]].
