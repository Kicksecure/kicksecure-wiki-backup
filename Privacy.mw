An overview of the privacy goals and non-goals of {{project_name_short}}, emphasizing its focus on security over privacy and anonymity.

* '''Respect for User Privacy:''' {{project_name_short}} avoids adding privacy-intrusive features, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Dash Ubuntu's controversial Amazon search lens], which transmitted data to Amazon. Furthermore, problematic software like GeoClue is excluded due to [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/issues/177 privacy concerns associated with GeoClue].
* '''Torified Operating System (APT) Upgrades:''' As documented in the chapter [[About#Hardening_by_Default|Hardening by Default]], {{project_name_short}} features torified operating system (APT) upgrades. This is a security measure designed to mitigate the risk of targeted, malicious software upgrades and should not be misconstrued as a privacy or anonymity feature.
* '''Security vs Privacy Project Focus:''' 
** {{project_name_short}} is primarily a security-focused operating system, emphasizing robust defense measures against various threats. 
** However, it is not primarily designed for privacy or anonymity. Users seeking anonymity should consider using {{whonix_wiki |wikipage=About |text=Whonix}}, which is based on, built upon the foundation of {{project_name_short}}. 
** Both Kicksecure and Whonix are developed by the same founder and some of the same [[contributors]] and share a [[history]] spanning {{project_age_years}} years.
* '''Referral to Whonix:''' 
** For those interested in enhancing their privacy and anonymity, installing Whonix for VirtualBox on top of Kicksecure is straightforward. 
** This can be achieved using the pre-installed {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Linux
|text=Whonix Linux Installer for VirtualBox
}}, by executing the command {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=whonix-xfce-installer-cli}}. 
** For additional details and guidance, the Whonix website is a valuable resource.
