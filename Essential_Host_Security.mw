This page is targeted at advanced users who wish to improve the general security of their host operating system to become even more secure.

= Host Security Essentials =

It is recommended to first read relevant Computer Security Education entries concerning host security, such as:

= Power Saving Considerations =

Users at high risk or traveling should avoid leaving a system in the suspend or standby state. Instead, the recommended power mode to use is hibernation. This will lock all system partitions to a safe state, though there is a small trade-off in startup time.

On GNU/Linux hosts, standby will not always result in having LUKS keys retained in memory. Some experimental projects <ref>https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/ubuntu-luks-suspend</ref> and custom setups with systemd+scripting are able to erase the keys before system suspend to avoid mistakes.

Following a system standby period, the network fingerprint for Tor on the {{project_name_gateway_long}} is identical to a standard Tor instance on the host that has gone through the same procedure. There are some old connections that go stale and need renewal, but nothing is seen by a network adversary because time leak identifiers have been stripped out of Tor's protocol / OpenSSL, and TCP Timestamps are gone.

To reconnect to Tor following a suspend / standby / hibernation period:

* {{non_q_project_name}}: Manual time adjustment is required or the VM can simply be powered off and then powered on again. <ref>This step will be unnecessary once hypervisor-specific post resume hooks are used, because guest clocks will be seamlessly updated upon power state changes from the host.</ref>
* {{q_project_name}}: After resume, time adjustment is automatic and seamless. <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/sdwdate/blob/master/etc/qubes/suspend-pre.d/30_sdwdate.sh</ref> <ref>https://github.com/Kicksecure/sdwdate/blob/master/etc/qubes/suspend-post.d/30_sdwdate.sh
