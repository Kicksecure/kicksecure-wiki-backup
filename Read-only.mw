Depending on the user's use case. Choose one.

* '''A)''' ISO users installing {{project_name_short}}: Using the [[ISO]] just to install {{project_name_short}}? This does not matter. The user can ignore any live mode related warnings. These are not applicable.
* '''B)''' Interested in live mode? See below.

When using [[Live Mode|live mode]] ([[grub-live]] or [[ISO]] live), no changes are made to the disk. For added security, consider setting your disk to read-only mode, <u>if possible</u>.

Sometimes it is possible to optionally set the disks to read-only. This increases the security of live mode because otherwise malware running as root could theoretically mount the image read-write and gain persistence in this way.

= Introduction =
The emphasis is on <u>if possible</u>.

This is platform-specific.

Unfortunately, read-only mode is not easily available on all platforms.

Write protection can refer to very different security proprieties. See [[Verified_Boot#Write_Protection]].

== VirtualBox ==
Step-by-step guide on implementing the Immutable Disk Method for Virtual Machine (VM) Live Mode in VirtualBox, focusing on secure, read-only VM configurations.

This option is the official method for setting VMs to read-only in VirtualBox. It will only work with the <code>grub-live</code> package, which is installed by default. <ref>
This option will not work with the <code>ro-mode-init</code> package.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Make the [[VirtualBox]] disk immutable / read-only.

This step is crucial. Otherwise, contents might be recoverable from the host drive. <ref>
VirtualBox implements hard disk write protection differently. If an immutable virtual machine is booted, VirtualBox will always create a snapshot where data is written. After shutting down and booting the VM again (a soft reboot is inadequate), the old snapshot will be deleted and a new one created. Consequently, data will not persist in the VM, even if Live-mode is not selected. However, since the data is written to the hard disk of the host (instead of memory), it is easily recoverable. Therefore, selecting Live-mode is essential for safety. A snapshot file is still created, but it will not store any altered content from the VM.
</ref>

Follow these steps:

{{Box|text=
# Power off the VM.
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to: <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Tools</code> &rarr; <code>Virtual Media Manager</code>.

# Select the disk to write-protect and release it.
# Then on <code>Type</code> &rarr; <code>set it to Immutable</code>.

[[File:vbox-livemode2.png|800px]]

# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to the settings of the VM.
# Under storage, select the top controller and add the existing hard disk there.

'''2.''' Launch live-mode.

Follow the documentation on the [[Live Mode]] wiki page.

'''3.''' Done.

The process of enabling read-only mode has been completed.

'''1.''' Set the VM disks to read-only.

Follow these steps:

* Power off the machine.
* Set the hard disk to read-only in the virt-manager GUI before booting into live mode.

'''2.''' Launch live-mode.

Follow the documentation on the [[Live Mode]] wiki page.

'''3.''' ''Optional:'' Revert the read-only change.

To boot into normal mode again, revert the change from step 1 and choose the normal boot option in the GRUB menu.

'''4.''' Done.

The process of enabling read-only mode has been completed.

<code>grub-live</code> is currently [[unsupported]] on [[Qubes]]. <ref>
