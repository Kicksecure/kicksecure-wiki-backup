{{intro|
The <code>ro-mode-init</code> automatically enables live-mode if it detects that the disk is set to read-only.

This is an alternative to the default [[grub-live]] based method documented on [[VM Live Mode|VM Live Mode]].
}}
= Introduction =
<code>ro-mode-init</code> is currently less tested than <code>grub-live</code> ([[Live Mode]]).

{{Testers-Only}}

* Does not work on newer builds of {{project_name_short}} because these come with [[dracut|<code>dracut</code>]] by default.
* This is for systems with <code>initramfs-tools</code> only. 
}}

<code>ro-mode-init</code> has not been ported to <code>dracut</code> yet. Theoretically this is probably possible, but it has not happened yet.

'''4.''' Set the VM disk to read-only.

The [[#Read-only_VM_Setting|read-only VM]] setting is necessary (see below), otherwise the VM disk will always boot into persistent mode.
}}

= Read-only VM Setting =

== VirtualBox ==

=== Read-only disk on VirtualBox ===

To boot into live mode, apply the following steps.

{{VirtualBox_Read_Only_Disk}}

=== Read-write disk on VirtualBox ===

To boot into read-write mode again, simply revert this change.

# Power off the machine.
# From the command line run:

Use the syntax below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata vmname "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

Replace <code>vmname</code> with the actual VM name.

== KVM ==

=== Read-only disk on KVM ===

To boot into live mode, apply the following steps:

# Power off the machine.
# Set the hard disk to read-only in the virt-manager GUI.
# Power on the machine and select to boot into live mode.

=== Read-write disk on KVM ===

To boot into normal mode again, simply revert this change:

# Power off the machine.
# Set the hard disk to read-write in the virt-manager GUI.
# Power on the machine and boot into read-write mode.

= Debugging =

An inconsistent filesystem will likely result in errors during booting in live mode. For instance, inconsistencies can arise when the VM is killed instead of performing a normal shutdown in persistent mode. Therefore, to ensure it is consistent, run <code>fsck</code> in persistent mode. Debian automatically does this during boot. VMs running in live mode can be killed without problems.

In the case of non-<code>fsck</code> related errors using <code>ro-mode-init</code> (like dropping to an initramfs shell), add the following to the kernel command line/GRUB menu for easier debugging:

{{CodeSelect|code=
debug=1 break=init-premount
