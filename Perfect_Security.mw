{{intro|
A discussion of the definition of "perfect security" in computing, and why it remains unattainable.

While the idea of achieving perfect security is appealing, it is fundamentally impossible. This page explains why, with supporting evidence from renowned computer security researchers, programmers, and educators. Below is a curated collection of expert perspectives illustrating the technical, economic, and practical limitations of perfect security.

{{quotation
|quote=For a variety of technical reasons, computer security is extraordinarily weak. If a sufficiently skilled, funded, and motivated attacker wants in to your computer, they’re in. If they’re not, it’s because you’re not high enough on their priority list to bother with.

|quote=You can't secure what you don't understand.

The worst enemy of security is complexity. This has been true since the beginning of computers, and it’s likely to be true for the foreseeable future.

{{quotation
|quote=A secure system must defend against all possible attacks—including those unknown to the defender. But defenders, having limited resources, typically develop defenses only for attacks they know about. New kinds of attacks are then likely to succeed. So our growing dependence on networked computing systems puts at risk individuals, commercial enterprises, the public sector, and our military.

|quote=So computer and network security in practice starts at the hardware and firmware underneath the endpoints. Their security provides an upper bound for the security of anything built on top.

|quote=Defensive security is a difficult game, because one doesn't immediately see whether a given solution works or not. This is in stark contrast to other engineering disciplines (and to offensive security) where one usually have immediate feedback on whether something works well or not.

{{quotation
|quote=Research in cybersecurity may seem reactive, specific, ephemeral, and indeed ineffective. Despite decades of innovation in defense, even the most critical software systems turn out to be vulnerable to attacks. Time and again. Offense and defense forever on repeat. Even provable security, meant to provide an indubitable guarantee of security, does not stop attackers from finding security flaws. As we reflect on our achievements, we are left wondering: Can security be solved once and for all?

{{quotation
|quote=The term “secure operating system” is both considered an ideal and an oxymoron. Systems that provide a high degree of assurance in enforcement have been called secure systems, or even more frequently “trusted” systems 1. However, it is also true that no system of modern complexity is completely secure. The difficulty of preventing errors in programming and the challenges of trying to remove such errors means that no system as complex as an operating system can be completely secure.

There is no perfect security in any real system—hardware fails, people make mistakes, and attacks outside our expectations may defeat our protection mechanisms.

{{IntroLike|
Perfect security, while conceptually appealing, is unattainable due to the inherent complexity of computing systems, the limits of defensive knowledge, and the evolving nature of attacks. Even highly resourced and well-designed systems remain vulnerable when confronted with unknown exploits, hardware trust issues, or human error. Economic constraints and usability trade-offs further prevent the implementation of flawless defenses.
