= Performance Monitoring Overview =

* This website needs performance testing in regular intervals to guarantee optimal performance for our visitors to prevent issues due to new scripts etc
* For that we created a https://gtmetrix.com/ account. We also use https://pagespeed.web.dev/
* Below there are performance test templates (how to perform a metric test) and the metric results from the last tests
* The date format is usually YYMMDD.HHMM
* New tests can be added in their respective new chapters (headlines)
* Use the TOC to navigate to the different tests
* For implementation details see [[Dev/mediawiki#Performance_Testing]]

= Currently unused testing options =

== ?debug=true ==

* Every page on the wiki can be called with the url parameter ?debug=true
* This changes how page is loaded. And scripts and CSS are not compressed

== ?dontload=... ==

* Every page can also use the url parameter dontload
* You can find the complete documentation [[Dev/mediawiki#Debug-via-url-modal|for this here]]

= Actual Tests =

== Landing Page Test (gtmetrics) ==

* https://www.whonix.org To see how the page loading is affected use multiple runs of the same tests on gtmetrics
* Perfom test runs of each of the following tests and write down the result for the given properties (Gr = grade, Pf = performance, St = structure, Cl = cumulative layout shift)

* London x Unthrottled (L)
* London x 4G slow (L4)
* Vancouver x Unthrottled (V)
