{{intro|
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for managing user accounts in {{project_name_short}}, enhancing system security and facilitating multi-user environments.
}}

= Add a New User =
Optional!

To create a new user account named <code>user2</code>, execute the following command:

Note: Replace <code>user2</code> with the desired username for the new account.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser user2
}}

This command will prompt you to set a password and fill in additional information for the new user. Ensuring each user has a unique account helps maintain system security and organizes user-specific configurations.

= Allow New User to Login to Virtual Console =
Optional!

This step is necessary only if the new user account should have access to the [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|Virtual Console]] for direct system interaction without a graphical interface. This can be useful for users that will also be members of the <code>sudo</code> group for purposes of [[recovery]].

(This is related to security feature [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]].)

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser user2 console
}}

= Allow New User Sudo Access =
Optional!

If you want <code>user2</code> to perform administrative tasks with elevated privileges, add them to the <code>sudo</code> group.

See also [[Root|Safely Use Root Commands]] for best practices when executing commands as root.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser user2 sudo
}}

Adding <code>user2</code> to the <code>sudo</code> group enables them to execute commands with root privileges by prefacing commands with <code>sudo</code>. Use this responsibly to prevent unintended system changes.

= Switch User =
To switch to the new user account, follow these steps:

Start menu &rarr; <code>Log Out</code> or <code>Switch User</code> &rarr; login

* '''Username''': <code>user2</code>
* '''Password''': The password set during the creation of <code>user2</code>.

= User Restrictions =
TODO: document topics not covered yet

* restricted shell (any secure available?)
* libpam-chroot (might be weak?)
* /etc/security/limits.conf
* file system quotas
* snoopy
* Logging off idle users
