{{intro|
VirtualBox Guest Additions is a software package that provides additional functionality to virtual machines (VMs) running in VirtualBox. The Guest Additions package includes drivers and utilities that enhance both performance and usability of the VMs.

Guest Additions provides features such as clipboard sharing, seamless mouse integration, shared folder between the host and guest operating systems, improved graphics performance, and the ability to dynamically resize the guest display.

[[#VirtualBox Guest Additions|Guest Additions are installed by default in {{project_name_short}} and its derivatives such as {{Whonix}}.]]

<u>Important:</u> Clipboard sharing is currently '''broken in {{project_name_short}} 18'''. See [[#Clipboard Sharing|Clipboard Sharing]] for details.

= Clipboard Sharing =
{{IntroLike|
Clipboard sharing allows you to copy and paste text between the host and a {{VM}}.

This documentation explains the status of clipboard sharing in {{project_name_short}} and its derivatives such as [[Whonix]].

For <u>Shared Folder Security Considerations</u>, please press Learn More on the right side.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Shared folders are discouraged because they weaken isolation between the guest and the host. Providing a mechanism to access files of the host system from within the guest system via a specially defined path necessarily enlarges the attack surface and provides a potential pathway for malicious actors to compromise the host.

This recommendation does not have a strong rationale. Disabling additional features in other virtualizers or general applications will similarly lead to fewer code paths being utilized and arguably increase security. VirtualBox software is not special in this regard.

== Shared Folder Permission Fix ==
Should be no longer required.

Inside the VM... If running the following command...

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd /mnt/shared
}}

Leads to the following error:

<pre>
cd: permission denied: /mnt/shared
</pre>

Only then try the commands below.

For other error messages, there is no need to proceed with the commands below.

This is a simple Linux file permissions issue. These are usually easy to fix when understanding the Linux file permission system. Unfortunately, to the knowledge of the author, there is no single coherent tutorial on Linux file permissions that can be wholeheartedly recommended. Instead, specific commands to fix this issue only are being provided.

This issue should be mostly [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. [[Self Support First Policy]] is applicable. [[Please Use Search Engines And See Documentation First]].

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Do not attempt to use <code>chown</code> or <code>chmod</code> to fix the permissions of the shared folder. VirtualBox's shared folder feature does not understand UNIX file permissions. Attempting to change the permissions on the shared folder or its contents will fail.
}}

'''1.''' {{sysmaint_notice}}

'''2.''' '''Group configuration.'''

Add the Linux user account that will utilize shared folders from inside the VM to group <code>vboxsf</code>. The following example will use account "<code>user</code>".

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser user vboxsf
}}

<u>Optional:</u> If using <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>, the user might want to add account <code>sysmaint</code> as well.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser sysmaint vboxsf
}}

'''3.''' '''Reboot required.'''

Due to <code>adduser</code> making Linux user group modification.

{{CodeSelect|code=
reboot
}}

'''4.''' '''Done.'''

Linux file permissions should be fixed.

Other troubleshooting:

* {{IconSet|true|D}} Check <code>Make Permanent</code> (if that option exists).

This is specific to the VirtualBox version; newer versions may no longer have this option.

Check <code>Make Permanent</code> if this setting should persist after fully shutting down the virtual machine and booting it again. Otherwise, this setting will be temporary (though it will survive a reboot that does not involve a full shutdown).
</ref>

== Shared Folder in Live Mode ==
<!-- WIKI EDITORS NOTICE:
This is almost a duplicate of:
https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#Shared_Folder_in_Live_Mode
-->

In [[Live Mode]], the shared folder will not be mounted by default. (This behavior was introduced in version <code>17.4.4.6</code> and might change in a future release.) <ref>
[[grub-live]]:

* <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-vbox.service.d/30_grub-live.conf</code>
* <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-kvm.service.d/30_grub-live.conf</code>
</ref>

To enable the shared folder with read and write access in live mode, follow the instructions below.

{{IconSet|true|1}} '''Apply the instructions from the above chapter first.'''

Option-specific:

* If you are using Kicksecure (or a derivative such as Whonix), follow the steps below.
* If you are using other operating systems or the generic VirtualBox method, this does not apply. <ref>
Because {{project_name_short}} does not use the <code>mnt-shared-vbox.service</code> systemd unit.
</ref>

{{IconSet|true|2}} {{sysmaint_notice}}

}}

{{IconSet|true|5}} '''Save.'''

{{IconSet|true|6}} '''Reboot.'''

{{IconSet|true|7}} '''Done.'''

The shared folder should now also be available with read-write access after booting into live mode.

== VirtualBox Guest Additions Installation Sources ==
There are multiple sources to install {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} from. It is possible to switch from one installation source to another. However, only one installation source should be used at the same time. If migrating from one installation source to another, the previous installation source should first be disabled.

== VirtualBox Guest Additions Security ==
General concerns have been raised about the security of VirtualBox. For example, see the article [https://www.phoronix.com/news/OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap]. However, this refers to the kernel driver (on the host), not guest additions. For opposite viewpoints, see [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html here] and [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html here].

The situation might have improved since some kernel modules have been upstreamed (integrated) into the Linux mainline kernel. <ref>

= Alternatives =
It is possible to achieve similar functionality without installing guest additions:

* For file exchange with {{project_name_short}}, see [[File Transfer]] and [[File Sharing]].
* To achieve higher screen resolution, see [[VirtualBox/Higher_Screen_Resolution_without_installing_VirtualBox_Guest_Additions|Higher Screen Resolution without VirtualBox Guest Additions]].
* For mouse integration, it is possible to set a USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. However, this is recommended against because it requires adding a USB controller to VirtualBox. (<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Right-click on Virtual Machine</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Enable absolute pointing device</code>)

= Miscellaneous =
== Uninstall virtualbox-guest-additions-iso ==
This is discouraged and should not normally be required. However, if you wish to uninstall VirtualBox guest additions installed by <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> (created by {{project_name_short}} developers), follow the steps below.

'''1.''' Note about package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>.

No purge of <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is required since <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> effectively does nothing if VirtualBox guest additions packages are already installed. If purging <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is desired, that is acceptable too.

'''2.''' Uninstall Oracle style VirtualBox guest additions.

To remove VirtualBox guest additions (previously installed by {{project_name_short}} from <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>), run the VirtualBox guest additions uninstaller provided by the VirtualBox developers:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/sbin/vbox-uninstall-guest-additions
}}

== Debugging ==
To help debug issues, inspect the following logs and services:

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /var/log/vboxadd-install.log
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd-service.service
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls -la /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-*/init/
}}

=== Kernel Upgrades ===
The following issue may occur during kernel [[Operating System Software and Updates|upgrades]].

This issue should be rare. It is only known to happen when using <code>initramfs-tools</code>. At time of writing, {{project_name_short}} switched from <code>initramfs-tools</code> to [[dracut]] by default.

<pre>
/etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd:
VirtualBox Guest Additions: Building the modules for kernel 5.6.0-0.bpo.2-amd64.
Failed to rename process, ignoring: Operation not permitted
update-initramfs terminated by signal TERM.
</pre>

Workaround: Two (2) reboots are required. <ref>
This results in guest additions being non-functional after the next reboot. During that reboot, VirtualBox guest additions will automatically detect the missing kernel modules for the upgraded kernel and build them. After rebooting one more time, the issue should be resolved until the next kernel upgrade.
