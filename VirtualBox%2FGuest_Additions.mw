{{intro|
VirtualBox Guest Additions is a software package that provides additional functionality to virtual machines (VMs) running in VirtualBox. The Guest Additions package includes drivers and utilities that enhance the performance and usability of the VMs.

Guest Additions provides features such as seamless mouse integration, shared folders between the host and guest operating systems, improved graphics performance, and the ability to resize the guest display dynamically.

[[#VirtualBox Guest Additions|Guest Additions are installed by default in {{project_name_short}} and its derivatives such as {{Whonix}}.]]

= Clipboard Sharing =
== Clipboard Sharing Security Considerations ==
Bidirectional clipboard sharing is currently enabled by default in {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox VM. <ref>
[https://forums.whonix.org/t/host-whonix-gateway-clipboard-sharing-enable-by-default/894 Host -> Whonix-Gateway clipboard sharing enable by default?]
</ref> There are good reasons to disable clipboard sharing. The decision for the user to disable clipboard sharing or not.

Shared folders are discouraged because it weakens isolation between the guest and the host. Providing a mechanism to access files of the host system from within the guest system via a specially defined path necessarily enlarges the attack surface and provides a potential pathway for malicious actors to compromise the host. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/security-risks-of-virtualbox-shared-folders/10119
</ref> <ref>
To learn more about VirtualBox shared folders, see: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders VirtualBox Manual - Chapter 4. Guest Additions].
</ref>
<ref>
Admittedly, this recommendation does not have a strong rationale. Disabling additional features in other virtualizers or general applications will similarly lead to less code paths being utilized and arguably increasing security. VirtualBox software is not special in this regard.
</ref>

== Clipboard Sharing Instructions ==

To change the clipboard sharing setting:

# Power off the virtual machine. <ref name=poweroff>Because otherwise you cannot change VirtualBox VM settings.</ref>
# Navigate to <code>VirtualBox machine settings</code> &rarr; <code>General</code> &rarr; <code>Advanced</code> &rarr; <code>Shared Clipboard</code>
# Set the preferred configuration: <code>Disabled</code>, <code>Guest to Host</code>, <code>Host to Guest</code> or <code>Bidirectional</code>.
# Power on the virtual machine again.

The automatic mounting method is described below. For additional information on shared folders, refer to the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders VirtualBox manual]. Any additional questions are unspecific to {{project_name_short}} and should be addressed as per the [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]].

<blockquote>
With the shared folders feature of Oracle VM VirtualBox, you can access files of your host system from within the guest system. This is similar to how you would use network shares in Windows networks, except that shared folders do not require networking, only the Guest Additions.

== Shared Folder Permission Fix ==
Should be no longer required.

Inside the VM... If running the following command...

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd /mnt/shared
}}

Leads to the following error:

<pre>
cd: permission denied: /mnt/shared
</pre>

Only then try the commands below.

For other error messages, there is no need to proceed with the commands below.

This is a simple Linux file permissions issue. These are usually easy to fix when understanding the Linux file permission system. Unfortunately, to the knowledge of the author, there is no single coherent tutorial on Linux file permissions that can be wholeheartedly recommended. Instead, specific commands to fix this issue only are being provided.

This issue should be mostly [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. [[Self Support First Policy]] is applicable. [[Please Use Search Engines And See Documentation First]].

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = Do not attempt to use <code>chown</code> or <code>chmod</code> to fix the permissions of the shared folder. VirtualBox's shared folder feature does not understand UNIX file permissions. Attempting to change the permissions on the shared folder or its contents will fail.
}}

'''1.''' {{sysmaint_notice}}

'''2.''' '''Group configuration.'''

Add the Linux user account that will utilize shared folders from inside the VM to group <code>vboxsf</code>. The following example will use account "<code>user</code>".

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser user vboxsf
}}

<u>Optional:</u> If using <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>, the user might want to add account <code>sysmaint</code> as well.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo adduser sysmaint vboxsf
}}

'''3.''' '''Reboot required.'''

Due to <code>adduser</code> making Linux user group modification.

{{CodeSelect|code=
reboot
}}

'''4.''' '''Done.'''

Linux file permissions should be fixed.

Other troubleshooting:

* {{IconSet|true|D}} Check <code>Make Permanent</code> (if that option exists).

This is specific to the VirtualBox version; newer versions may no longer have this option.

Check <code>Make Permanent</code> if this setting should persist after fully shutting down the virtual machine and booting it again. Otherwise, this setting will be temporary (though it will survive a reboot that does not involve a full shutdown).
</ref>

= VirtualBox Guest Additions =
== Introduction ==
In {{project_name_short}}, VirtualBox guest additions are installed by default. <ref>
* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default/700 Installing VirtualBox Guest Addition by Default?]
</ref>

To avoid any issues with the guest additions, users are highly recommended to:

# Use the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version for use with {{project_name_short}}]].
# Leave installation of the recommended version of VirtualBox guest additions to {{project_name_short}} as dcoumented and to avoid manual installation. This documentation will be updated as required. Check back later in case you have issues.

There might be a few odd messages during [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|updates]] which are actually [[#Non-Issues|non-issues]]. Unless actual functionality is broken, please do not ask about odd messages as per [[Reporting_Bugs#Support_Request_Policy|Support Request Policy]].

In case of issues, see also [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting|VirtualBox troubleshooting]] and consider a [[Reporting_Bugs|bug report]].

== VirtualBox Guest Additions Installation Sources ==
There are multiple sources to install {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} from. It is possible to switch from one installation source to another. However, only 1 installation source should be used at the same time. If migrating from one installation source to another, the previous installation source should be disabled.

| From Debian's (<code>fasttrack.debian.net</code>) packages <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code>.
|
* Adjusted by Debian specifically for Debian. Works very well when using the same version of the VirtualBox host software as well as VirtualBox guest additions.
* After installation of the package(s), VirtualBox Guest Additions will be fully setup and functional.
| {{Yes}}
| {{Yes}}
|-

! B
| Host ISO
| VirtualBox guest additions ISO / CD
|
* This is the VirtualBox guest additions ISO / CD from Oracle, which is the company that develops VirtualBox.
* This ISO is shipped with the VirtualBox host software.
* The ISO contains generic VirtualBox guest additions installer for many Linux versions.
* Not specifically designed for Debian.
* Only recommended in case [[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Install_from_VirtualBox.org_Repository|installing a newer version of VirtualBox from the VirtualBox.org Repository]] than available from Debian and only recommended if the ISO cannot instead be installed from the next entry in this table.
* To actually install VirtualBox guest additions from this source, the user would have to mount or extract the ISO and run the setup installer as was per instructions on the [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#additions-linux VirtualBox website].

|-

! C
| Oracle Style
| From Debian's (<code>packages.debian.org</code>) package [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>].
|
* Similar to above.
* A Debian maintainer has built the VirtualBox guest additions ISO and added it to the <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> package to provide a more convenient method to acquire the ISO.
* Installation alone of the package does effectively nothing. The package essentially only includes file <code>/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code>.
* Only recommended in case [[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Install_from_VirtualBox.org_Repository|installing a newer version of VirtualBox from the VirtualBox.org Repository]] than available from Debian.
* To actually install VirtualBox guest additions from this source, the user would have to, either:

{{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} (from packages <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code>) are installed by default and should be preferred over <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>. <ref name=legacy15>
<code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is still installed by default. Should there be issues with <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code> as there was in past due to unavailability, then it's easier to fall back to that solution. <code>vbox-guest-installer</code>] (installation helper created by {{project_name_short}} developers) is also still installed by default for the same purpose.
</ref>

== vbox-guest-installer ==
[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist/blob/master/usr/bin/vbox-guest-installer <code>vbox-guest-installer</code>] is an installation helper created by {{project_name_short}} developers. It is a helper utility for better usability that allows to install {{Code2|VirtualBox guest additions}} from Debian's (<code>packages.debian.org</code>) package [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>].

* Not enabled by default.
* Usually no user action required.
* Usually no enable/disable or settings change required.

Whenever the Linux kernel package or <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is upgraded, <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> should be automatically running. <ref>
<code>debian/vm-config-dist.triggers</code>
</ref>

<code>vbox-guest-installer</code> will refuse to install VirtualBox guest additions from package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> when either package <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code> and/or package <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code> is still installed. This is because only 1 installation source should be used by default as mentions in chapter [[#VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions_Installation_Sources|VirtualBox Guest Additions Installation Sources]].

== Migration to Oracle Style VirtualBox Guest Additions ==
If the user is currently using VirtualBox packages <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code> and <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code> (Debian style) and wishes to migrate to Oracle Style VirtualBox Guest Additions from package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>, complete the following steps.

'''1.''' Uninstall the Debian style VirtualBox Guest Additions Packages.

This step is mandatory. Otherwise [[#vbox-guest-installer|vbox-guest-installer]] would refuse to install Oracle Style VirtualBox Guest Additions because only 1 installation source for guest additions must be active at the same time.

{{CodeSelect|code=

== VirtualBox Guest Additions Security ==
General concerns have been raised about the security of VirtualBox, for example see the article [https://www.phoronix.com/news/OTk5Mw The VirtualBox Kernel Driver Is Tainted Crap] . However, this refers to the kernel driver (on the host), not guest additions. For opposite viewpoints, see [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00112.html here]  and [https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00116.html here].

The situation might have improved since some kernel modules have been upstreamed (integrated) to the Linux mainline kernel. <ref>
* https://www.phoronix.com/news/VirtualBox-Guest-V2-Continues
* https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-4.16-vboxguest
* <code>vboxguest</code>: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-4.16-Three-New-Subsystems

* search term: {{CodeSelect|code=
site:kernel.org vbox
}}
</ref>

= Alternatives =
It is possible to achieve similar functionality without installing guest additions:
* For file exchange with {{project_name_short}}, see: [[File Transfer]] and [[File Sharing]].
* To achieve a higher screen resolution, see: [[VirtualBox/Higher Screen Resolution without installing VirtualBox Guest Additions|Higher Screen Resolution without VirtualBox Guest Additions]].
* To achieve mouse integration, it is possible to set a USB tablet in VirtualBox settings. This is recommended against because it requires adding a USB controller to VirtualBox. (<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>Right-click on Virtual Machine</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Enable absolute pointing device</code>)

= Miscellaneous =
== Uninstall virtualbox-guest-additions-iso ==
This is discouraged and should not be required. However, if you wish to uninstall VirtualBox guest additions as installed by <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> by {{project_name_short}} developers, follow the steps below.

'''1.''' Note about package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>.

No purge of package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> required since <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> effectively does nothing if VirtualBox guest additions packages are installed. If purging <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is desired this is OK too.

'''2.''' Uninstall Oracle style VirtualBox guest additions.

To remove VirtualBox guest additions (previously installed by {{project_name_short}} from <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>), run VirtualBox guest additions uninstaller by VirtualBox developers.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo /usr/sbin/vbox-uninstall-guest-additions
}}

== Debugging ==
To help debug issues, inspect the following logs and services.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /var/log/vboxadd-install.log
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl status vboxadd-service.service
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls -la /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-*/init/
}}

=== Kernel Upgrades ===
The following issue is happening during kernel [[Operating System Software and Updates|upgrades]].

<pre>
/etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd:
VirtualBox Guest Additions: Building the modules for kernel 5.6.0-0.bpo.2-amd64.
Failed to rename process, ignoring: Operation not permitted
update-initramfs terminated by signal TERM.
</pre>

Workaround in short: two reboots required.

Workaround details: This results in guest additions being non-functional after the next reboot. During the next reboot VirtualBox guest additions will automatically detect the missing kernel modules for the upgraded kernel and build them. Therefore when rebooting yet another time the issue should be resolved until the next kernel upgrade.

Please [[contribute]] to generic bug reproduction:

* Conceptually: [[Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction|Generic Bug Reproduction]]
* Specifically: [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#VirtualBox_Generic_Bug_Reproduction|VirtualBox Generic Bug Reproduction]] and [[#Debugging|Debugging]].

See also {{project_name_short}} specific technical information, [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Integration|VirtualBox Integration]].

One long term solution might be replacing initramfs-tools with dracut but that needs further research and development work. ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/replacing-initramfs-tools-with-dracut/4487 develpoment discussion], [https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/1565 issue])
