Development Notes about OpenPGP Signed Website
}}
= OpenPGP Signed Website =
This has been requested in the forum. <ref>https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/6d7344a5/</ref> Having an OpenPGP Signed Website would be desirable, but that would require software which does not yet exist.

There is [https://www.sanface.com/pgphtml.html PGPHTML: to make PGP or GPG signed web-pages], but it is from 2002 and has licensing problems. <ref>Patrick Schleizer emailed <code>licensing at fsf dot org</code> (name redacted). PGPHTML is probably not Free Software. If that is the case, it would not be usable for {{project_name_long}}. Adrelanos also emailed the author, but there was no response.

The license doesn't explicitly permit modifications, nor distribution
for a fee (even the relatively terse Expat license, sometimes
ambiguously referred to as the MIT License, explicitly states that you
have: "... without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
...")

It also states that "fixes ...  accepted" in the same block as the
license text, so it is unclear if that is a part of the license or a
friendly request.

I can't speak to what was the author's intent when writing the license;
It is not my place to say "oh, the author of the license probably
meant..." Therefore I would recommend contacting the author before using
the software and asking for a copy of the software under a well known
free software license.

PGPHTML also wouldn't work as a complete solution.

* Users most likely won't copy and paste the text, so this would also require a browser or browser addon to automate the verification.
* Adversaries in a position to modify website content can always mount rollback or indefinite freeze attacks (see <ref>[[Dev/Permanent_Takedown_Attack_Defender#Definitions]]</ref> for definitions of those attacks). For example, they could serve an old message or website that was signed years ago and now contains insecure or outdated information, without the user being aware of the attack. To prevent that, the client application would have to check a field similar to the Valid-Until field <ref>
https://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/23/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html
</ref>.
* The website structure or link would also have to be signed and verified.
* It should pass the [https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/SECURITY.md TUF] threat model.

While relying on the OpenPGP web of trust instead of the [[SSL|SSL cartel]] could provide strong verification, it likely wouldn't offer end-to-end encryption. SSL or .onion would still be required for that.

This is an interesting idea, but developing such a solution is outside the scope of {{project_name_short}}.
