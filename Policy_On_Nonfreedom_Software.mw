Permitted / Prohibited Discussions, Project Philosophy on Non-Freedom Software

__FORCETOC__
= Introduction =

The {{project_name_short}} project is a Freedom Software project.

{{project_name_short}} is not a Freedom Software maximalist project, since it does not adhere to the [https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG)]. However, {{project_name_short}} will not bundle any unnecessary, major non-freedom software software components or contribute to these.

* Helping users who ask about non-freedom software; for example - "How do I use Wickr?" Answer: "See the [[Wickr]] wiki page."
* Community-contributed documentation about popular non-freedom software such as [[VMware]] and Hyper-V.
* Discussions about Freedom Software that rely on Non-Freedom server software; for example - Telegram Client (Freedom Software) that requires connections to the Telegram server (Non-Freedom Software).
* Discussion about Freedom Software alternatives to non-freedom software; for example - "What's a Libre alternative to team viewer?" Answer: "See the [[Remote Administration]] wiki page."
* Running {{project_name_short}} on top of non-freedom operating systems such as [[Windows]] and [[macOS]].
* Non-freedom [[Firmware Security and Updates]] and [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Processor_Microcode_Updates|Processor Microcode Updates]].
|-

! scope="row"| Prohibited Topics
|
* Unsolicited recommendations of non-freedom applications; for example - "How do I use remote support?" Answer: "Use anydesk" (prohibited).
* Debates about the features and security of closed vs Open Source Software are unwelcome.
|-

! scope="row"| Contributions to Non-Freedom Software
|
* Examples include Non-freedom software hypervisors such as VMware and Hyper-V.
* Unless [[Professional_Support|paying for professional support]] (and hosted on separate website if hosted), it must be hosted without references to the {{project_name_short}} [[Trademark_Policy|trademark]] and website.
|-

! scope="row"| Policy Rationale
| This policy has been devised for the following reasons:
* Avoiding endless, circular and non-productive debates.
* Clearly defining the {{project_name_short}} project philosophy.
* [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|Avoiding Non-Freedom Software]]
* [[Reporting_Bugs#Community_Feedback|Community Feedback Policy]]
* Brand protection - the {{project_name_short}} project is known to be a Freedom Software project. It is undesirable to harm this brand by bundling it with unnecessary non-freedom software components.
