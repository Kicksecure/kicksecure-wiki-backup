Hardened Memory Allocator for many Applications to increase Security
}}
= Introduction =

Hardened Malloc (Default) is a hardened memory allocator which can be used with many applications to increase security.

According to the author's GitHub description: <ref>
https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc
</ref>

<blockquote>This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities. The security-focused design also leads to much less metadata overhead and memory waste from fragmentation than a more traditional allocator design. It aims to provide decent overall performance with a focus on long-term performance and memory usage rather than allocator micro-benchmarks. It offers scalability via a configurable number of entirely independently arenas, with the internal locking within arenas further divided up per size class.</blockquote>

Readers who wish to discuss the integration of Hardened Malloc with {{project_name_long}} should refer to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc-hardened-memory-allocator/7474 this forum thread].

= Naming =
The author of <code>Hardened Malloc</code> uses only the terms:

* <code>Hardened Malloc</code>
* <code>Hardened Malloc Light</code>

To distinguish better which version is used, this websites uses the terms:

* <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code> (also historically called <code>Hardened Malloc original</code> - this term is deprecated in the [[systemcheck]] utility and will be changed in the next update)
* <code>Hardened Malloc Light</code>

This is unrelated to price. Both versions are Freedom Software, free as in price as well as in freedom.

<code>Hardened Malloc Light</code> is provided for cases in which <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code> cannot be used due to application specific issues. <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code> might trigger issues due to memory allocation bugs found in some applications.

= Installation =

Hardened Malloc (Default) is pre-installed.

= How-to: Launch Applications with Hardened Malloc Default =
{{Testers-only}}

== Launch Specific Applications with Hardened Malloc Default ==
To launch chosen applications with Hardened Malloc (Default), the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable must be edited before starting the application.

For example, to launch <code>application-name</code> in this way, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
LD_PRELOAD='/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc.so' application-name
}}

Using administrative rights, example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo LD_PRELOAD='/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc.so' apt update
}}

== Launch Systemd Services with Hardened Malloc Default ==
To launch individual systemd services with Hardened Malloc (Default), add a drop-in systemd configuration snippet.

{{CodeSelect|code=
Environment="LD_PRELOAD='/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc.so'"
}}

== Launch All Applications by Default with Hardened Malloc Default ==
It is possible to make all applications use Hardened Malloc (Default) as the default memory allocator.

<u>Note</u>:

* <u>If using a graphical desktop environment</u> (such as Xfce): This action breaks the graphical desktop environment (Xorg). Most users using a graphical desktop environment (such as Xfce) should not proceed enabling Hardened Malloc (Default) for all applications. Only [[Hardened Malloc Light]] is suitable for that.
* <u>If using a command line interface (CLI)</u> (no graphical desktop environment) (such as a server): This can be attempted! Testers only!

To configure this option, the path to the <code>hardened_malloc.so</code> library must be added to the <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> file. <ref>
[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ <code>glibc</code>] feature request: [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24913 <code>/etc/ld.so.preload.d</code> drop-in configuration folder support]
</ref>

{{Box|text=
'''1.'''
{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/ld.so.preload
}}

'''2.''' Add the <code>hardened_malloc.so</code> library.

Paste.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc.so
}}

'''3.''' Save the file.

'''4.''' Done.

The procedure is complete. Hardened Malloc Default has been enabled for all applications by default.
}}

== Disable Hardened Malloc per Application ==
In case Hardened Malloc Default/Light is enabled globally for all applications it is possible to disable it for select applications should that be required due to application incompatibilities.

Apply the following steps to disable Hardened Malloc Default/Light per application.

Prepend the [https://github.com/Kicksecure/helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/bin/ld-system-preload-disable <code>ld-system-preload-disable</code>] wrapper.

Syntax:

{{CodeSelect|code=
ld-system-preload-disable application
}}

Example:

Notes:

* This disabled all ld system preload. This only matters in case the user previously modified ld system preload configuration file <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> which the vast majority of users does not do.
* Replace <code>[[chromium]]</code> with the actual application which should be started without ld system preload.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ld-system-preload-disable chromium
}}

=== VirtualBox Host Software ===
[https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20107 VirtualBox crashes with hardened memory allocator Hardened Malloc on the host.] <ref>
* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VBoxMainLogging
* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Core_dump
</ref>

However, using HM inside VirtualBox VMs is different. For that, see above.

=== Browsers ===

Using Hardened Malloc Default/Light with Tor Browser or Firefox is difficult and [[unsupported]]. <ref name=firefox-based>
Tor Browser is also based on Firefox, therefore the following advice equally applies.

<blockquote>
LD_PRELOAD='/path/to/libhardened_malloc.so' /path/to/program will do nothing or approximately nothing.
</blockquote>

The reason is recompilation is necessary.

<blockquote>
To successfully replace Firefox memory allocator you should either use LD_PRELOAD _with_ a --disable-jemalloc build OR Firefox's replace_malloc functionality:
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/replace_malloc.h

</blockquote>

It is unknown whether other browsers can benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light.

=== Flatpak ===
[[Install_Software#Flatpak|Flatpak]] does not honor <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code>. Therefore using Hardened Malloc with Flatpak applications is currently [[unsupported]]. <ref>
[[Install_Software#Flatpak|Flatpak]] does not honor <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code>.
Viewing contents of <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> on the host operating system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/ld.so.preload
}}

Expected output:

<pre>
/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc-light.so
</pre>

Starting a shell inside a Flatpak application sandbox. This example uses <code>org.chromium.Chromium</code> and could be replaced with any other Flatpak application.

{{CodeSelect|code=
flatpak run --command=sh org.chromium.Chromium
}}

Viewing contents of <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> inside the Flatpak sandbox.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/ld.so.preload
}}

Conclusion: File  <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> does not exist inside the Flatpak sandbox.

<pre>
cat: /etc/ld.so.preload: No such file or directory
</pre>
</ref>

=== snap ===
[[Install_Software#snap|snap]] is [[untested]]. Possibly has the same issue as [[#Flatpak|Flatpak]].

=== Others ===
Other applications might not easily benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light for the same reasons outlined in the [[#Browsers|browsers]] section above.

Whether an application can benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light or not depends on technical implementation details of the application in question. Vendors of applications will probably know if their application is compatible with Hardened Malloc Default/Light. Community wiki contributions are most welcome -- please post any additional vendor Q&As here.

= How-to: Check Hardened Malloc Status =
== Check If Hardened Malloc is Enabled ==

Open the terminal and type either:

* '''A)''': Using <code>hardened-malloc-enabled-test</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
hardened-malloc-enabled-test
}}
** If enabled, should output should show: <blockquote>yes</blockquote>
* '''B)''': For advanced users: Using [[systemcheck]] with command line parameter <code>--verbose</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
systemcheck --verbose
}}
** If enabled, should output should include: <blockquote>[INFO] [systemcheck] Hardened Malloc: Hardened Malloc enabled.</blockquote>

== Check If Hardened Malloc Default or Hardened Malloc Light is Enabled ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
hardened-malloc-type-test
}}

Possible outputs:

* <code>none</code>
* <code>original</code> - meaning Hardened Malloc (<code>Default</code>)
* <code>light</code>
