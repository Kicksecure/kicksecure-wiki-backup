= Deprecation in Kicksecure =
Context:

* This context was added in November 2025.
* The original rationale was written in February 2024.
* Purpose of this explanation: To justify the integration or non-integration of hardened_malloc into Kicksecure (and Whonix), from the perspective of distribution development.

Reasons - written in February 2024:

* '''Not stable enough:''' Through testing and integration development in Kicksecure, the unresolveable [[#Issues]] being found, it has been determined that it will never be stable enough to be suitable for installation by default for all users.
* '''Unclear Benefit:''' See chapter [[#Tickets and Discussions]]. Whenever it has been suggested to other projects to port to Hardened Malloc (HM), it did not get favorable reviews from other developers.
* '''Lack of outreach by upstream:''' Upstream mentioned that others do not understand HM but also does not have time to engage with them.
* '''Potential future deprecation by upstream:''' [[#Upstream Considerations of Hardened Malloc Deprecation for x86|Upstream contemplated deprecation of Hardened Malloc support for usage outside of a Android / GrapheneOS context.]]
* '''Security issues?''' '''No.''' Users can keep using Hardened Malloc (Default) or Hardened Malloc Light until the next major release (Kicksecure version 18) but it will be [[unsupported]].
* <s>'''Architecture support:''' '''Limited.''' (HM supports AMD64 architecture only, which makes Kicksecure progress towards multiple architecture support such as ARM64 and PPC harder.)</s>
** Update November 2025: The original issue can no longer be identified, possibly due to [[#Upstream Deleting Posts|Upstream Deleting Posts]]. It may have been similar to [https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/issues/228 Build issue on Rocky Linux 9 aarch64 #228], a compilation issue that might have been resolvable in theory, but Kicksecure lacked the resources to maintain a fix at the time this was written. As of February 2024, HM offered no direct support for Debian. Pull request [https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/pull/90 Debian packaging work in progress #90] received no feedback and was locked without explanation. This is entirely within the rights of the HM project, which has no obligation to support other Linux distributions. However, it is relevant context and has contributed to the deprecation of HM in Kicksecure, and is therefore included here.
* '''Future:''' Is there any chance this package will get unarchived, maintained again in Kicksecure? No.
* '''Forum discussion:''' https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc-hardened-memory-allocator/7474/231

New reason - added November 2025:

* '''Upstream is difficult to work with:''' Upstream has declined communication and issued bans.
** https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/2025/08/19/grapheneos-daniel-micay-banned/
** https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/grapheneos-attacks-kicksecure-what-should-the-response-be/739/6
** [[#Upstream Deleting Posts|Upstream Deleting Posts]]
*** Upstream’s decision to disengage will be respected.
*** To clarify, no private communication has occurred.
*** All prior interactions have fortunately taken place in public.

== NOINDEX ==
For context, wiki page Hardened Malloc uses wiki keyword <code>NOINDEX</code>. Quote Wikipedia:

{{quotation
|quote=The noindex value of an HTML robots meta tag requests that automated Internet bots avoid indexing a web page.
|context=[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noindex Wikipedia article <code>noindex</code>]

This is done deliberately to prevent the page from appearing in Google and other search engine results. The intention is to minimize drama. Discussion about hardened malloc is not a core activity of the project. Those interested in Kicksecure’s development and integration perspective can find the details; otherwise, the topic is considered sufficiently addressed.

= Introduction =

Hardened Malloc (Default) is a hardened memory allocator which can be used with many applications to increase security.

{{Quotation
|quote=This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening against heap corruption vulnerabilities. The security-focused design also leads to much less metadata overhead and memory waste from fragmentation than a more traditional allocator design. It aims to provide decent overall performance with a focus on long-term performance and memory usage rather than allocator micro-benchmarks. It offers scalability via a configurable number of entirely independently arenas, with the internal locking within arenas further divided up per size class.

Readers who wish to discuss the integration of Hardened Malloc with {{project_name_short}} should refer to [https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc-hardened-memory-allocator/7474 this forum thread].

= Naming =
The author of <code>Hardened Malloc</code> uses only the terms:

* <code>Hardened Malloc</code>
* <code>Hardened Malloc Light</code>

To distinguish better which version is used, this websites uses the terms:

* <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code>
* <code>Hardened Malloc Light</code>

This is unrelated to price. Both versions are Freedom Software, free as in price as well as in freedom.

<code>Hardened Malloc Light</code> is provided for cases in which <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code> cannot be used due to application specific issues. <code>Hardened Malloc (Default)</code> might trigger issues due to memory allocation bugs found in some applications.

= Installation =

Hardened Malloc (Default) is pre-installed.

= How-to: Launch Applications with Hardened Malloc Default =
{{Testers-only}}

== Launch Specific Applications with Hardened Malloc Default ==
To launch chosen applications with Hardened Malloc (Default), the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable must be edited before starting the application.

For example, to launch <code>application-name</code> in this way, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
LD_PRELOAD='libhardened_malloc.so' application-name
}}

Using administrative rights, example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo LD_PRELOAD='libhardened_malloc.so' apt update
}}

== Launch Systemd Services with Hardened Malloc Default ==
To launch individual systemd services with Hardened Malloc (Default), add a drop-in systemd configuration snippet.

{{CodeSelect|code=
Environment="LD_PRELOAD='libhardened_malloc.so'"
}}

== Launch All Applications by Default with Hardened Malloc Default ==
It is possible to make all applications use Hardened Malloc (Default) as the default memory allocator.

<u>Note</u>:

* <u>If using a graphical desktop environment</u> (such as Xfce): This action breaks the graphical desktop environment (Xorg). Most users using a graphical desktop environment (such as Xfce) should not proceed enabling Hardened Malloc (Default) for all applications. Only [[Hardened Malloc Light]] is suitable for that.
* <u>If using a command line interface (CLI)</u> (no graphical desktop environment) (such as a server): This can be attempted! Testers only!

To configure this option, the path to the <code>hardened_malloc.so</code> library must be added to the <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> file. <ref>
[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ <code>glibc</code>] feature request: [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24913 <code>/etc/ld.so.preload.d</code> drop-in configuration folder support]
</ref>

{{Box|text=
'''1.'''
{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/ld.so.preload
}}

'''2.''' Add the <code>hardened_malloc.so</code> library.

Paste.

{{CodeSelect|code=
libhardened_malloc.so
}}

'''3.''' Save the file.

'''4.''' Done.

The procedure is complete. Hardened Malloc Default has been enabled for all applications by default.
}}

== Disable Hardened Malloc per Application ==
In case Hardened Malloc Default/Light is enabled globally for all applications it is possible to disable it for select applications should that be required due to application incompatibilities.

Apply the following steps to disable Hardened Malloc Default/Light per application.

Prepend the {{Github_link|repo=helper-scripts|path=/blob/master/usr/bin/ld-system-preload-disable|text=<code>ld-system-preload-disable</code>}} wrapper.

Syntax:

{{CodeSelect|code=
ld-system-preload-disable application
}}

Example:

Notes:

* This disabled all ld system preload. This only matters in case the user previously modified ld system preload configuration file <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> which the vast majority of users do not do.
* Replace <code>[[chromium]]</code> with the actual application which should be started without ld system preload.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ld-system-preload-disable chromium
}}

=== Browsers ===
==== Firefox ====

Using Hardened Malloc Default/Light with Firefox is broken and [[unsupported]]. <ref name=firefox-based>
Tor Browser is also based on Firefox, therefore the following information equally applies to both, Tor Browser and Firefox.

<blockquote>
LD_PRELOAD='/path/to/libhardened_malloc.so' /path/to/program will do nothing or approximately nothing.
</blockquote>

The reason is recompilation is necessary.

<blockquote>
To successfully replace Firefox memory allocator you should either use LD_PRELOAD _with_ a --disable-jemalloc build OR Firefox's replace_malloc functionality:
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/replace_malloc.h

==== Tor Browser ====
Using Hardened Malloc Default/Light with Tor Browser is also is broken and [[unsupported]]. Same as above. This is because Tor Browser is based on Firefox. <ref>
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-malloc-hardened-memory-allocator/7474/202
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/42104

}}
* If using Tor Browser Starter (package: <code>tb-starter</code>) by Whonix developers:
** {{CodeSelect|code=

}}

==== Chromium ====
Using Hardened Malloc Default/Light with [[Chromium]] is also is broken and [[unsupported]]. <ref>
* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=971876
** workaround <code>ld-system-preload-disable chromium</code> ok
** chromium from flathub also functional (Hardened Malloc Light is disregarded inside flatpak's bubblewrap based sandbox)

{{Quotation
|image=Deep-web-1106648640.jpg
|context=Anonymously contributed wiki edit.
|quote=[https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/ crosvm] functions only if an option is specified at compile time

* CrosVM ships with strict Seccomp policies that block syscalls not typically generated by CrosVM.
* The hardened_malloc library generates calls a syscall for a random number generator, which will be blocked silently.
* Append string <code>getrandom: 1</code> to <code>jail/seccomp/x86_64/common_device.policy</code>, which permits the RNG syscall for all CrosVM devices.
* Other <code>getrandom: 1</code> entries must be removed from files in <code>jail/seccomp/x86_64/*</code>, as CrosVM will not compile with duplicate entries for devices.
* Without this addition: if too much data is buffered at once by the serial console or NIC, the device subprocess will crash, and thus the rest of the virtual machine.
* Without this addition, errors regarding seccomp violations for <code>nr_random</code> syscalls are detected in strace.

==== Other Browsers ====
It is unknown whether other browsers can benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light.

=== Flatpak ===
[[Install_Software#Flatpak|Flatpak]] does not honor <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code>. Therefore using Hardened Malloc with Flatpak applications is currently [[unsupported]]. <ref>
[[Install_Software#Flatpak|Flatpak]] does not honor <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code>.
Viewing contents of <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> on the host operating system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/ld.so.preload
}}

Expected output:

<pre>
libhardened_malloc-light.so
</pre>

Starting a shell inside a Flatpak application sandbox. This example uses <code>org.chromium.Chromium</code> and could be replaced with any other Flatpak application.

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

Viewing contents of <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> inside the Flatpak sandbox.

{{CodeSelect|code=

=== snap ===
[[Install_Software#snap|snap]] is [[untested]]. Possibly has the same issue as [[#Flatpak|Flatpak]].

=== php ===
<code>php</code> command from <code>php8.2-cli</code> php package segfaults.

{{CodeSelect|code=
php
}}

<pre>
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  php
</pre>

To start PHP on the command line without Hardened Malloc, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ld-system-preload-disable php
}}

If PHP is started by other applications such as a web server, it is currently [[untested]] if that is broken.

=== Others ===
Other applications might not easily benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light for the same reasons outlined in the [[#Browsers|browsers]] section above.

Whether an application can benefit from Hardened Malloc Default/Light or not depends on technical implementation details of the application in question. Vendors of applications will probably know if their application is compatible with Hardened Malloc Default/Light. Community wiki contributions are most welcome -- please post any additional vendor Q&As here.

==== Upstream Deleting Posts ====
Certain statements were made and later deleted, making meaningful cooperation difficult.

* Michael Altfield was banned from the GrapheneOS project by Daniel Micay after submitting a feature request and reopening a previously deleted issue. No specific misconduct was identified, and Daniel Micay subsequently deleted his own comments and declined to explain the rationale behind the ban, leaving Michael Altfield uncertain about the reason.

Why does this wiki chapter, "Upstream Deleting Posts", exist? It originates from a [https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/secureblue/35566 public Qubes forum discussion] that references [[Hardened_Malloc#Deprecation_in_Kicksecure|Deprecation in Kicksecure]]. Statements cited in the "Deprecation in Kicksecure" section linked to posts that were subsequently deleted. This chapter provides evidence that upstream has a history of deleting links.

= How-to: Check Hardened Malloc Status =
== Check If Hardened Malloc is Enabled ==

Open the terminal and type either:

* '''A)''': Using <code>hardened-malloc-enabled-test</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
hardened-malloc-enabled-test
}}
** If enabled, should output should show: <blockquote>yes</blockquote>
* '''B)''': For advanced users: Using [[systemcheck]] with command line parameter <code>--verbose</code>. {{CodeSelect|code=
systemcheck --verbose
}}
** If enabled, should output should include: <blockquote>[INFO] [systemcheck] Hardened Malloc: Hardened Malloc enabled.</blockquote>

== Check If Hardened Malloc Default or Hardened Malloc Light is Enabled ==

{{CodeSelect|code=
hardened-malloc-type-test
}}

Possible outputs:

* <code>none</code>
* <code>default</code>
* <code>light</code>

= Kicksecure Feature Default Status Information =
(A) blocker, reason why Hardened Malloc is not enabled by default in Kicksecure yet is because it [[#Browsers|breaks browsers]], which would be confusing.
