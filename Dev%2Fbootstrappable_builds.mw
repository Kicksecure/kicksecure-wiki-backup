Bootstrappability refers to the ability to build a complete operating system or software stack from source code, starting with minimal and independently verifiable binaries. This concept is central to software freedom and trustworthiness, particularly in the context of reducing reliance on opaque binary blobs.

Many mainstream Linux distributions, including Debian, are not fully bootstrappable. This means they depend on precompiled binaries at some stage in their build process, making it difficult to independently verify the entire software supply chain.

For example, Debian among other Linux distributions are unbootstrappable.
