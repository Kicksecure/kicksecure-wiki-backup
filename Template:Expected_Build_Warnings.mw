Can not write log, openpty() failed (/dev/pts not mounted?)
</pre>
This does not affect the build. <ref>This is nothing to be concerned about; it only happens because commands are run inside chroot. Research of this "issue" indicates it is purely cosmetic.</ref>

[....] Your system does not have the CPU extensions required to use KVM. Not doing anything. ...[ FAIL ]
</pre>
This does not affect the build. <ref>KVM is installed as a dependency of the build dependency libguestfs-tools. KVM is not needed to build the actual images.</ref>

[....] Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules [ ok ].
[....] Starting VirtualBox kernel modules[....] No suitable module for running kernel found ...[ FAIL ]
invoke-rc.d: initscript virtualbox, action "restart" failed.
</pre>
This does not affect the build. <ref>This only means that VirtualBox cannot be started. VirtualBox kernel modules could not be compiled because the {{Code|linux-headers-$(uname -r)}} package was not installed prior to installing VirtualBox (before starting Whonix's build script). The build script doesn't start VirtualBox, hence does not affect the build. The build script only uses {{Code|VBoxManage}} for creation of virtual machine description files and that tool doesn't need VirtualBox kernel modules.</ref>

WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
	 Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
	 headers, most likely linux-headers-486.

	 You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.

This does not affect the build. <ref>This is caused by the same issue referenced above.</ref>

<pre>
dpkg: warning: failed to open configuration file '/root/.dpkg.cfg' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>
This does not affect the build. <ref>This happens because {{Code|debuild}} is run as user, not root. It is probably a bug in dpkg. Research of this issue reveals there are many similar bugs in dpkg.</ref>

<pre>
sudo: unable to resolve host host
</pre>
This does not affect the build. <ref>
Hostname inside VM image gets changed intentionally to <code>host</code> inside the VM image. The cause probably is package anon-base-files postinst running <code>hostname "$my_host_name"</code> / <code>hostname host</code>. This change should only happen inside the change root <code>chroot</code>. We might get rid of this issue by porting form <code>chroot</code> to <code>systemd-nspawn</code>, but it is not very important.
