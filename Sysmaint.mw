{{intro|
Starting from {{project_name_short}} version <code>17.3.0.5</code> Xfce and above, {{project_name_short}} comes with [[sysmaint|<code>user-sysmaint-split</code>]] by default.

There are two accounts:

* <code>user</code> - For daily activities.
* <code>sysmaint</code> - For system maintenance administrative activities, such as installing software or upgrading.

This is a security feature. ([[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|rationale]])

The opposite of <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is [[unrestricted_admin_mode|Unrestricted Admin Mode]], which users can opt in to enable.

= Default Installation Status =

* '''Old versions:''' {{project_name_short}} build versions up to <code>17.2.8.5</code> will <u>not</u> be upgraded to install <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default. Users however can opt-in to install it, see [[#Installation]]. The package will likely get installed by default when major [[Release Upgrade]] to version <code>18</code> is performed.
* '''New versions:'''
** '''host:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-xfce</code> will come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''CLI:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-cli</code> will <u>not</u> come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''servers:''' <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> will not be installed by default on servers.
** '''[[Distribution Morphing]]:''' Depending on chosen meta package.

[[File:Sysmaint-tty.png|thumb|The sysmaint console session.]]

When <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is installed, the account <code>user</code> will no longer be able to use privilege escalation tools (<code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, <code>pkexec</code>) when logged into any account other than <code>sysmaint</code>.

This change takes effect immediately.

To perform system maintenance tasks such as checking for software updates, installing updates, etc, the user will have to reboot into the <code>sysmaint</code> account. To do this, restart the system normally, then select <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance.)</code> from the boot menu. The system will boot into a minimal desktop session with the System Maintenance Panel running. To reduce attack surface, most superfluous background services are suppressed while booted into the <code>sysmaint</code> account.

The <code>sysmaint</code> desktop session is intentionally minimal and not suited for normal desktop use. This is to discourage using it for work that has a higher risk of causing a difficult-to-avoid system compromise (such as web browsing). Quick shortcuts are provided for simple software management and system administration tasks, while more advanced tasks can be performed from a terminal. The <code>sudo</code> and <code>pkexec</code> commands will be usable here.

Once you are done with system maintenance tasks, click "Reboot" to reboot the system. Then boot into <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code> or <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>. This will provide you with a standard desktop session.

When booted in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>, you can also log into the <code>sysmaint</code> account from a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]] (<code>tty</code>). Simply input the account name <code>sysmaint</code> at the login prompt. This session behaves identically to a typical virtual console session. A short informational message will be printed after login reminding you that the <code>sysmaint</code> account must be used with caution.

Qubes version specific.

* <u>In Qubes OS R4.2 and earlier:</u> {{q_project_name_long}} cannot be booted into sysmaint mode. However, <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is useful in Qubes VMs too because it makes SUID privilege escalation tools (<code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, <code>pkexec</code>) inaccessible for account <code>user</code>. You can access the root user account by opening a [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Root#Qubes_Root_Console Qubes Root Console].
* <u>Qubes OS R4.3 and later:</u> Support [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9750 boot modes]. {{q_project_name_long}} uses these to allow {{project_name_short}} any Qube to be booted in either <code>PERSISTENT mode USER</code> or <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>. By default, <code>{{project name workstation template}}</code> Template will boot in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>, while <code>{{project name workstation short}}</code> AppVMs and DispVMs will boot in <code>PERSISTENT mode USER</code>.

<code>PERSISTENT mode USER</code> and <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code> are mostlly functionally identical under Qubes OS. <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code> differs in the following ways:

* The default user account for most actions is changed to <code>sysmaint</code>.
* User-specific system services such as the X11 server run as account <code>sysmaint</code>.
* Potentially dangerous operations such as opening URLs are disabled.
* The [[System Maintenance Panel]] is usable.
* Privilege escalation tools are easily usable, since the <code>sysmaint</code> account will be provided rather than the <code>user</code> account.

It is possible to boot a {{project_name_short}} Qube in a non-standard boot mode (i.e. booting a Template in <code>PERSISTENT mode USER</code>, or booting an AppVM in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>). To do so, change the boot mode of the Qube before starting it.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Ensure the Qube is shut down.

'''2.''' Open Qube Manager.

<code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Gear icon</code> &rarr; <code>Qubes Tools</code> &rarr; <code>Qube Manager</code>

'''3.''' Click on the VM you wish to change the boot mode of.

'''4.''' Click "Settings" in the toolbar.

'''5.''' Click the "Advanced" tab in the Settings window.

'''6.''' In the "Kernel" section, change "Boot mode" to your desired boot mode.

'''7.''' Click "OK" in the Settings window.

'''8.''' Start the Qube. It will boot in the selected boot mode.

'''9.''' Done.

The procedure of switching the boot mode for a Qube is now complete.

Instead, reboot into <code>sysmaint</code> mode is required, as documented above.

= Notes =

* ''' <code>sysmaint</code> account restrictions''': Several restrictions are imposed to reduce the risk of the <code>sysmaint</code> account becoming compromised:
** '''Locked access depending on boot mode''': The <code>sysmaint</code> account is locked and cannot be logged into when booted into modes other than <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>.
** '''Session limitation''': Logging into the <code>sysmaint</code> account using anything other than the special <code>sysmaint</code> desktop session is prohibited.
** '''Discouragement of other logins''': When booted in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>, you will be discouraged (but not entirely prevented) from logging into accounts other than <code>sysmaint</code>. Locking accounts such as account <code>user</code> is not implemented, since doing so would make it very tricky or even impossible for the user to permanently lock accounts themselves.
** '''Inhibition of non-critical services''': When booted in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>, only the minimum services needed for the session to be usable are started by default. New services are prevented from automatically starting during APT software upgrades.

= Questions and Answers =
* Why is there a separate <code>sysmaint</code> account?
** See [[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|Rationale for Separate sysmaint Account]].

* Why is it required to boot into <code>sysmaint</code> mode, why not simply use start menu &rarr; switch user? ([[Sysmaint#Fast_User_Switching|Fast User Switching]])
** This is to mitigate [[login spoofing]] attacks and to to prevent [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|<code>sudo</code> password sniffing]].

* How to go back to [[unrestricted admin mode]], where user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>?
** See [[#Uninstallation]].

= user-sysmaint-split - GUI vs CLI - Default Installation Status Differences =

<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is different for the {{gui}} versus the {{cli}} version.

In the future, the CLI version will be improved to be more suitable for servers.

Server support for <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>, however, isn't as sophisticated yet as it is for the GUI version. For some server use cases, <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> may be less needed or unneeded. This topic is elaborated in the development chapter {{kicksecure_wiki
|wikipage=Dev/user-sysmaint-split#Server_Support
|text=<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> Server Support
}}.
