{{intro|
There are two users.

* <code>user</code> - For daily activities.
* <code>sysmaint</code> - For system maintenance administrative activities such as installing software, upgrading.

This is a security feature. ([[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|rationale]])

= Default Installation Status =

* '''Old versions:''' Kicksecure build versions up to <code>17.2.8.5</code> will <u>not</u> be upgraded to install <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default. Users however can opt-in to install it, see [[#Installation]]. The package will likely get installed by default when major [[Release Upgrade]] to version 18 is performed.
* '''New versions:'''
** '''host:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-xfce</code> will come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''CLI:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-cli</code> will <u>not</u> come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''servers:''' <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> will not be installed by default on servers.
** '''[[Distribution Morphing]]:''' Depending on chosen meta package.

After installing <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>, you will no longer be able to use <code>sudo</code> or <code>pkexec</code> when logged into any account other than <code>sysmaint</code>. Features of {{project_name_short}} that require privilege escalation will also no longer work. This change takes effect immediately.

To perform system maintenance tasks such as checking for software updates, installing updates, etc, you will have to reboot into the <code>sysmaint</code> account. To do this, restart the system normally, then select <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance.)</code> from the boot menu. The system will boot into a minimal desktop session with the System Maintenance Panel app running. To reduce attack surface, most superfluous background services are suppressed while booted into the <code>sysmaint</code> account.

The <code>sysmaint</code> desktop session is intentionally minimal and not suited for normal desktop use. This is to discourage using it for work that has a higher risk of causing a difficult-to-avoid system compromise (such as web browsing). Quick shortcuts are provided for simple software management and system administration tasks, while more advanced tasks can be performed from a terminal. The <code>sudo</code> and <code>pkexec</code> commands will be usable here.

Once you are done with system maintenance tasks, click "Reboot" to reboot the system. Then boot into <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code> or <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>. This will provide you with a standard desktop session.

You can also log into the sysmaint account from a TTY. Simply input the account name <code>sysmaint</code> at the login prompt. This session behaves identically to a typical TTY session. A short informational message will be printed after login reminding you that the <code>sysmaint</code> account must be used with caution.

= Notes =

* Several restrictions are imposed to reduce the risk of the <code>sysmaint</code> account becoming compromised:
** The <code>sysmaint</code> account is locked and cannot be logged into when booted into modes other than <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>.
** Logging into the <code>sysmaint</code> using anything other than the special sysmaint session is prohibited.
** When booted in <code>PERSISTEND mode SYSMAINT</code>, you will be discouraged (but not entirely prevented) from logging into accounts other than <code>sysmaint</code>. We don't lock accounts other accounts on the system, since doing so would make it very tricky or even impossible for the user to permanently lock accounts themselves.

= Questions and Answers =
* Why is there a separate <code>sysmaint</code> account?
** See [[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|Rationale for Separate sysmaint Account]].

* Why is it required to boot into <code>sysmaint</code> mode, why not simply use start menu -> switch user?
** This is to mitigate [[login spoofing]] attacks and to to prevent [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|<code>sudo</code> password sniffing]].

* How to go back to classic <code>sudo</code> mode, where user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>?
** See [[#Uninstallation]].

= Uninstallation =
This chapter documents how to disable <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> and to go back to classic sudo mode, where user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>.

Optional. Discouraged.

If <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> comes installed by default, the easiest to remove it is by using [[Debian_Packages#dummy-dependency|<code>dummy-dependency</code>]] to avoid meta package removal issues ([[Debian Packages]]).

the best case potentially realistic scenario for fast user switching from `user` to `sysmaint` - in theory - would be

1. logout with "save session" as user `user`. as in saving the session to disk and allow it to be resumed. but no processes must continue to run.

2. SysRq + SAK

3. login into sysmaint

4. logout sysmaint

5. SysRq + SAK (optional, just to establish the habbit)

6. resume user `user` session
