{{intro|
Starting from {{project_name_short}} version <code>TODO</code> Xfce and above, {{project_name_short}} comes with [[sysmaint|<code>sysmaint-user-split</code>]] by default.

There are two accounts:

* <code>user</code> - For daily activities.
* <code>sysmaint</code> - For system maintenance administrative activities, such as installing software or upgrading.

This is a security feature. ([[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|rationale]])

The opposite of <code>sysmaint-user-split</code> is [[unrestricted_admin_mode|Unrestricted Admin Mode]], which users can opt in to enable.

= Default Installation Status =

* '''Old versions:''' Kicksecure build versions up to <code>17.2.8.5</code> will <u>not</u> be upgraded to install <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default. Users however can opt-in to install it, see [[#Installation]]. The package will likely get installed by default when major [[Release Upgrade]] to version 18 is performed.
* '''New versions:'''
** '''host:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-xfce</code> will come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''CLI:''' Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-cli</code> will <u>not</u> come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default.
** '''servers:''' <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> will not be installed by default on servers.
** '''[[Distribution Morphing]]:''' Depending on chosen meta package.

[[File:System-maintenance-panel.png|thumb|The sysmaint desktop session.]]

[[File:Sysmaint-tty.png|thumb|The sysmaint console session.]]

When <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is installed, the user will no longer be able to use privilege escalation tools (<code>sudo</code> or <code>pkexec</code>) when logged into any account other than <code>sysmaint</code>. Features of {{project_name_short}} that require privilege escalation will also no longer work. ([[Dev/sudo]]) This change takes effect immediately.

To perform system maintenance tasks such as checking for software updates, installing updates, etc, the user will have to reboot into the <code>sysmaint</code> account. To do this, restart the system normally, then select <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance.)</code> from the boot menu. The system will boot into a minimal desktop session with the System Maintenance Panel running. To reduce attack surface, most superfluous background services are suppressed while booted into the <code>sysmaint</code> account.

The <code>sysmaint</code> desktop session is intentionally minimal and not suited for normal desktop use. This is to discourage using it for work that has a higher risk of causing a difficult-to-avoid system compromise (such as web browsing). Quick shortcuts are provided for simple software management and system administration tasks, while more advanced tasks can be performed from a terminal. The <code>sudo</code> and <code>pkexec</code> commands will be usable here.

Once you are done with system maintenance tasks, click "Reboot" to reboot the system. Then boot into <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code> or <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>. This will provide you with a standard desktop session.

You can also log into the <code>sysmaint</code> account from a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|virtual consoles]] (<code>tty</code>). Simply input the account name <code>sysmaint</code> at the login prompt. This session behaves identically to a typical virtual console session. A short informational message will be printed after login reminding you that the <code>sysmaint</code> account must be used with caution.

= Fast User Switching =
It is not possible to switch from account <code>user</code> to <code>sysmaint</code> using:

* Start Menu &rarr; logout
* Start Menu &rarr; switch user

This is a security feature. <ref>
[[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#Fast_User_Switching|<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> (developers), Fast User Switching]]
</ref>

Instead, reboot into <code>sysmaint</code> mode is required, as documented above.

= Notes =

* ''' <code>sysmaint</code> account restrictions''': Several restrictions are imposed to reduce the risk of the <code>sysmaint</code> account becoming compromised:
** '''Locked access depending on boot mode''': The <code>sysmaint</code> account is locked and cannot be logged into when booted into modes other than <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>.
** '''Session limitation''': Logging into the <code>sysmaint</code> account using anything other than the special <code>sysmaint</code> desktop session is prohibited.
** '''Discouragement of other logins''': When booted in <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT</code>, you will be discouraged (but not entirely prevented) from logging into accounts other than <code>sysmaint</code>. Locking accounts such as account <code>user</code> is not implemented, since doing so would make it very tricky or even impossible for the user to permanently lock accounts themselves.

= Questions and Answers =
* Why is there a separate <code>sysmaint</code> account?
** See [[Root#Rationale_for_Separate_sysmaint_Account|Rationale for Separate sysmaint Account]].

* Why is it required to boot into <code>sysmaint</code> mode, why not simply use start menu &rarr; switch user? ([[Sysmaint#Fast_User_Switching|Fast User Switching]])
** This is to mitigate [[login spoofing]] attacks and to to prevent [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|<code>sudo</code> password sniffing]].

* How to go back to [[unrestricted admin mode]], where user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>?
** See [[#Uninstallation]].
