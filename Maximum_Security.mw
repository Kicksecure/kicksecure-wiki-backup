{{intro|
A discussion of the definition of "maximum security" in computing.

While the idea of achieving maximum security is appealing, it is either more of a theoretical absolute goal, assuming reaching a level of no-further-improvable security. Or it is a term describing being the undisputed best in a competition of high security contenders. The term are vague and the metrics are intangible.

How much time, motivation and/or money are you willing to spend on it?

If one wants to accomplish maximum security, any Linux distribution should be avoided as much as possible. One would need to consider using approaches such as [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ <u>L</u>inux <u>F</u>rom <u>S</u>cratch (LFS)].

{{quotation
|quote=LFS offers you added security
You will compile the entire system from source, thus allowing you to audit everything, if you wish to do so, and apply all the security patches you want or need to apply. You don't have to wait for someone else to provide a new binary package that (hopefully) fixes a security hole. Often, you never truly know whether a security hole is fixed or not unless you do it yourself.
|context=[https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/ Why would I want an LFS system?]
}}

LFS allows to tailor the operating system for a specific use-case only. The attack surface can be limited to one specific use-case only.

Linux isn't maximally secure either.

Look for alternatives or build your own kernel.

Use specialized hardware and operat system.
