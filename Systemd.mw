= systemd versus non-systemd =
{{project_name_short}} is a systemd-based distribution. {{project_name_short}} is not anti-systemd.

The {{project_name_short}} lead developer isn't convinced of anti-systemd arguments justifying moving to a non-systemd distribution.

Non-systemd is [[unsupported]] because no contributors support this use case.

The interfaces (the way how packages and distributions can place configuration files there) of 

* <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/unit-name.service(.d)</code>;
** ability to use easily use capabilities and syscalls filters for security hardening
* [https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service.html systemd tmpfiles.d] / <code>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/</code>;

is excellent.

The [https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_INTERFACE/ The Boot Loader Interface] <code>LoaderSystemToken</code> feature sounds excellent.

Bad things:

* journal log being binary
* adding <code>systemd</code> into the name of tools such as <code>systemd-resolved</code>, <code>systemd-networkd</code> and making these systemd dependent
* systemd-boot only supporting Intel/AMD64 architecture
|context={{project_name_short}} lead developer opinion.
