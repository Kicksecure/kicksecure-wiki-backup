{{project_name_short}} requires a critical mass of users to properly test planned updates by enabling the [[APT Repository#{{project_name_short}}_APT_Repository_Overview|stable-proposed-updates]] or [[APT Repository#{{project_name_short}}_APT_Repository_Overview|testers]] repository. <ref>
The developers repository is only recommended for experts or those in touch with {{project_name_short}} developers.
</ref> Otherwise, bugs might go undiscovered and be inadvertently introduced into the stable repository.

To ensure a stable {{project_name_short}} system is available at all times, willing testers should:

* Create new {{project_name_workstation_long}} and {{project_name_gateway_long}} Templates solely for testing.
* Enable the <code>stable-proposed-updates</code> or <code>testers</code> repository via the [[APT Repository#Change_{{project_name_short}}_APT_Repository|Derivative Repository Tool]].

Then perform normal user activities.

Please only report bugs ''after'' first searching relevant {{project_name_short}} forums and developer portals for the problem. ([[Please_Use_Search_Engines_And_See_Documentation_First|Please Use Search Engines And See Documentation First]])
