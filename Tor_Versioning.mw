Note that a later Tor version will not always be installed from either:

* '''A)''' [[#Install Tor from Backports|Install Tor from Backports]], or
* '''B)''' The Tor Project APT repository -- in the recent past, the Debian <code>bullseye</code> repositories for <code>packages.debian.org</code> and <code>deb.torproject.org</code> had identical Tor versions. In general, as the Debian stable release ages, the likelihood of receiving a newer Tor version from <code>deb.torproject.org</code> increases.

= The Tor Project APT Repository =

{{mbox
| type    = notice
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    = If the latest Tor version from ''deb.torproject.org'' has not been fully tested by {{project_name_short}} developers at a specific point in time, then problems can emerge such as broken connectivity. <ref>
At the time of writing Tor v4.2.5 was non-functional in {{project_name_short}}.
</ref> Testers should <u>always</u> maintain a separate, working version of {{project_name_short}} so future connectivity problems can be averted.
}}

If you wish to proceed despite the risk, two steps are required:
* The <code>deb.torproject.org</code> repository must be enabled.
* The [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo <code>anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo</code>] package must be installed, since it enables The Tor Project's APT signing key and installs the apt source ''torproject.list'' <ref>Alternatively, [https://support.torproject.org/apt/#tor-deb-repo The Tor Project's native instructions for Debian] can be used, but the manual steps are more difficult and involved. The verification of The Tor Project APT signing key is also harder. Since you already [[trust]] {{project_name_short}}, the logical choice is to trust another {{project_name_short}} package to install the right signing key.</ref>
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' In {{project_name_gateway_long}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code>), [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''2.''' Install <code>anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install anon-shared-build-apt-sources-tpo
}}

'''3.''' ''<u>Optional</u>'': select an alternative Tor Project distribution for the Tor package.

{{Open with root rights|
filename=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
}}

Comment out <code>deb tor+https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main</code> by adding a hash (<code>#</code>) in front of it. Comment in a different [https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/ distribution] by removing the hash in front of it or by adding a newer <code>deb</code> URI line.

Save the file.

'''4.''' Refresh the package lists. <ref>So the newly installed <i>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list</i> takes effect.</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''5.''' Install the (potentially) newer version of the <code>tor</code> package.

This step also installs the <code>deb.torproject.org-keyring</code> package which keeps the Tor Project repository apt key up-to-date.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
}}
}}

{{Anchor|Onionize Tor Project Updates}}

= Onionize Tor Project APT Repository =

Only follow these instructions if [[#Newer Tor Versions: The Tor Project Repository|Newer Tor versions from The Tor Project Repository]] was configured. Note that The Tor Project deb apt signing key must be added first (see the prior link), or error messages will appear when completing these steps.

Run the following commands in {{project_name_short}}.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Create a ''torproject.list'' file using an editor.

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list
}}

'''2.''' Cut and paste the following text and comment out (#) the corresponding http repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
#deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org bullseye main
deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] tor+http://apow7mjfryruh65chtdydfmqfpj5btws7nbocgtaovhvezgccyjazpqd.onion/torproject.org bullseye main
}}

Save and exit.

{{Anchor|Qubes R4}}

= Install Tor from Backports =
This can be an alternative to Tor installation from The Tor Project's APT Repository, which is documented above.

{{Install Backport|package=
tor
}}

= Install Tor from Source Code =
Advanced users only!

All steps should be performed inside {{project_name_gateway_short}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_vm}}</code>).
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Add the Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> <u>source</u> repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "deb-src tor+https://deb.debian.org/debian {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main" {{!}} sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-source.list
}}

'''2.''' [[Update]] the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

'''3.''' Install build dependencies for Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt build-dep tor
}}

'''4.''' Fetch the signing key. <ref>
* https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en
* https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/
* [https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/web/support/-/issues/152 stop using gpg keyservers / provide OpenPGP keys for download as files from torproject.org]
* https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/web/support/-/issues/139
</ref>

{{Gpg_key_download}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 7A02B3521DC75C542BA015456AFEE6D49E92B601
}}

If the attempt fails, utilize the v3 onion service instead.

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --keyserver zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion --recv-keys 7A02B3521DC75C542BA015456AFEE6D49E92B601
}}

'''5.''' Download the Tor source code archive.

<u>Note</u>: Replace Tor version <code>{{Tor_upstream_version}}</code> with the actual Tor version to be downloaded.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://dist.torproject.org/tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}.tar.gz
}}

'''6.''' Download and verify the Tor source code OpenPGP signature.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl-download https://dist.torproject.org/tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}.tar.gz.asc
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
gpg --verify tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}.tar.gz.asc
}}

The output should look similar to the following.

<blockquote>gpg: assuming signed data in 'tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}.tar.gz'
gpg: Signature made Mon 09 Dec 2019 06:21:51 PM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 7A02B3521DC75C542BA015456AFEE6D49E92B601

'''7.''' Extract the Tor source code archive.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tar xvzf tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}.tar.gz
}}

'''8.''' Navigate to the Tor source code folder.

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd tor-{{Tor_upstream_version}}/
}}

'''9.''' Run configure and build the binary package.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./configure
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
make
}}

The build should now be finished.

'''10.''' Check the version of the built binary.

{{CodeSelect|code=
./src/app/tor --version
}}

The output should show.

<blockquote>Tor version {{Tor_upstream_version}}.</blockquote>

'''11.''' ''{{q_project_name_long}} only'': copy the newly built binary to {{project_name_gateway_short}} Template (<code>whonix-gw-{{VersionShort}}</code>).

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-copy ./src/app/tor
}}

'''12.''' Stop Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl stop tor
}}

'''13.''' Copy the newly build Tor binary to the system.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp ./src/app/tor /usr/sbin/tor
}}

Copy the binary again. <ref>
<code>apt-file list tor</code> shows both locations <code>/usr/bin/tor</code> and <code>/usr/sbin/tor</code>.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo cp ./src/app/tor /usr/bin/tor
}}

'''14.''' Restart Tor.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl start tor
}}

The process of installing Tor from source code is now complete.
}}

= Tor Version Downgrade =
It is usually not required to downgrade the Tor version. This should be only used in very specific cases to work around a bug or for testing.

'''1.''' Platform specific notice.

* non-Qubes users: No special notice.
* Qubes users: In Template.

'''2.''' Show available Tor versions.

{{CodeSelect|code=
apt list tor -a
}}

'''3.''' Downgrade for example to Tor version <code>0.4.7.16-1</code>.

Note: The version number was appropriate at time of writing but might need replacement in the future.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install tor=0.4.7.16-1 tor-geoipdb=0.4.7.16-1
}}

'''4.''' Platform specific notice.

* non-Qubes users: No special notice.
* Qubes users: Shut down Template.

'''5.''' Reboot.

A reboot of the (VM) running Tor is required.

'''6.''' Done.

The process of Tor version downgrade has been completed.
