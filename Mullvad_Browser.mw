= Mullvad VPN =
To the knowledge of the author written in February 2024...

One might make the assumption that a browser developed a VPN provider's, uses the VPN provider's VPN by default. Therefore one might assume that Mullvad Browser (MB) uses Mullvad VPN by default.

* Does MB use Mullvad VPN by default? No.
* Does MB Firefox extension allow to enable Mullvad VPN directly inside Firefox or MB? No.
* What is the purpose of MB Firefox extension? It shows the status if Mullvad VPN is in use or not. It  also comes with a fail-closed mechanism. If enabled, when using Mullvad VPN system wide (through the usual means of enabling a VPN without using any specific browser) then it will make sure that the browser cannot generate non-VPN traffic.

Please ask Mullvad for clarification, not {{project_name_short}}. Please edit the wiki should this information be incorrect or outdated.
