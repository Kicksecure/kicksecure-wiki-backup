'''{{project_name_short}} Unified Design''': To give {{project_name_short}} a unified design we maintain profile, banner and post images, tailored towards different platforms.

}}
= Definitions =

'''{{project_name_short}} Unified Design Logos''' are subdivided into:

* '''Landscape Logo''': A wide version of the Standard Logo where the width is min 2:1 ratio of width to height
* '''Text Logo''': A textform version of the Standard Logo which could be used in a text paragraph. Can be identical with Landscape logo if this is wide
* '''Icon Logo''': A simplified version of the Standard Logo for cases where the logo needs to be very small. If the logo is already very simple this might be identical to basic Logo

'''Use cases''' where {{project_name_short}} logos will be typically used are:

* '''Profile Image''': On various platforms there will usually be profile images which are used to identify the user. In most cases a square image will which be displayed as a square or a circle

= Guidelines =

* Generally the images referenced in this page should be used on the different platforms. New images should be agreed upon with the {{project_name_short}} team
* The word "{{project_name_short}}" in text is always used with a starting uppercase letter. Only in the logos this might vary.
* '''Name structure for Logo images''' - apply only to images that fit one of the logo definitions above: <code>{{project_name_short}}-logo-definition.bmp</code>, for example <code>{{project_name_short}}-logo-standard.svg</code>
* '''Name structure for graphical components''' - apply only to graphical components (see chapter) that are used as parts to create other images: <code>{{project_name_short}}-component-description.bmp</code>, for example <code>{{project_name_short}}-component-background.jpg</code>
* '''Name structure for other images''' - apart from logos and graphical components other images should be named by the use case like so: <code>{{project_name_short}}-image-usecase.bmp</code>, e. g. <code>{{project_name_short}}-image-twitter-profile.jpg</code>

= Current {{project_name_short}} graphical components =
