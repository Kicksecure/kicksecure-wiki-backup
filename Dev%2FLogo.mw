[[File:Kicksecure-icon-logo.png|thumb||{{project_name_long}} logo (icon version)]]
{{project_name_long}} Project logos, profile images and banners. Graphics can be found on this page. '''{{project_name_short}} Unified Design''': To give {{project_name_long}} a unified design we maintain profile, banner and post images, tailored towards different platforms. On this page guidelines are declared and gathered, for all images, but also for the general {{project_name_short}} Unified Design elements like text.

= Definitions =

The '''{{project_name_short}} Unified Design''' logos are subdivided into:
* '''Logo''': A squared or at max 2:1 ratio rectangular image representing the whole project
* '''Landscape logo''': A wide version of the logo where the width is min 2:1 ratio of height
* '''Text logo''': A textform version of the logo which could be used in a text paragraph. Can be identical with Landscape logo if this is wide
* '''Icon logo''': A simplified version of the logo for cases where the logo needs to be very small. If the logo is already very simple this might be identical to Logo

Use cases where {{project_name_short}} logos will be typically used are:
* '''Profile image''': On various platforms there will usually be profile images which are used to identify the user. In most cases a square image will which be displayed as a square or a circle
* '''Banner image''': On platforms there will mostly be the option to decorate your profile with a banner image. This image is often wide with a 3:1 ratio or more
* '''Post image''': To create posts about {{project_name_long}} there will be an image needed to represent {{project_name_long}} as an OS as a whole. These images of often around a 16:9 ratio
* '''Favicon''': To identify your page in a Browser there are very small images called favicons displayed in the browser tab before the text. Those images are squared, very small, eg 64x64px or 32x32px and can have transparency
