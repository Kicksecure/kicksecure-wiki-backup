= General Overview =

The issues discussed on this page are the same for any operating system and are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_long}}]].

= The Challenge of System Audits =

Performing system audits is beyond the reach of non-technical users. It requires a deep understanding of source code, the ability to utilize specialized analysis tools, and the expertise to interpret complex outputs. This level of proficiency is typically found in sysadmins or individuals with similar technical backgrounds.

Much like how a non-specialist cannot perform heart surgery, even a doctor outside of that field lacks the skills to do so. Thereâ€™s no shame in this limitation. It simply reflects the specialized knowledge required for such a task. Similarly, expecting a non-technical user to conduct a system audit is unrealistic.

= Limitations of Automated Tools =

There are no automated tools for end users with sufficient usability to be truly informative. Rather than providing insights, existing tools often lead to more questions and cause confusion. In general, this is related to the current state of development for security-focused operating systems. See:

= systemcheck and {{project_name_short}} =

For system checks, [[systemcheck]] is available on the {{project_name_short}} platform.

Even when system check tools exist, the thoroughness of checks performed by the software is a relevant question. An all-encompassing, automated testing suite for all functionality and security features remains a distant implementation goal.

= Certification and Audit Tools =

Some certification/audit tools exist, but they have poor usability. See: [[Dev/certification|Certification and Audits]].

= Trust and Expertise =

Realistically, users can only [[Trust]] that software works as described and intended, develop skills to undertake audits, and/or pay someone to perform that task.
