{{intro|
This page outlines the methodology often employed in scientific studies and demonstrates its application to computer issue research.
}}

During scientific research of new treatments, there are typically three distinct test groups:

* '''Active Treatment Group''': Participants receive the actual treatment or intervention being tested, allowing researchers to observe its effects directly.
* '''No Treatment Group''': This group receives no intervention, providing insight into the natural progression of the condition without any external influence.
* '''Control Group (Placebo)''': Participants receive a placebo—a treatment with no therapeutic effect—designed to resemble the active treatment, keeping both participants and researchers blind to the actual intervention.

This methodology can be applied to the analysis of computer issues as follows:

* '''Active Issue''': A system or binary that exhibits the actual issue or malfunction, allowing direct observation and study of the problem's behavior.
* '''No-Issue''': A system that remains unaltered, providing a baseline for typical system behavior, against which issues can be compared.
