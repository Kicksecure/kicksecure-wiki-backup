Fingerprinting versus Security

= chrony as a replacement for sclockadj =
== Introduction ==
Idea: use sdwdate to fetch the time, but set the time using chrony (new method) instead of using sclockadj (current method).

Problem with [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/sdwdate/blob/master/usr/src/sdwdate/sclockadj.c sclockadj] is that it uses clock_settime, which is causing issues. chrony uses [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#Adjusting_time_slowly_using_adjtimex/ntp_adjtime adjtimex], which will probably work better.

For that, chrony is configured in "offline mode", i.e., not contacting any remote servers to fetch the time. chrony is only supposed to set the time, which sdwdate should feed into chrony through its unix domain socket driver protocol.

== Instructions ==
'''1.''' Platform-specific.

* Debian: No special steps required.
* Qubes: Required in Qubes only.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo touch /var/run/qubes-service/clocksync
}}

'''2.''' Remove all other time synchronization daemons.

This is to avoid other time synchronization daemons competing for any clock changes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt purge ntp* sdwdate systemd-timesyncd
}}

'''3.''' Install chrony.

{{Install Package|package=
chrony
}}

'''4.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/chrony/conf.d/30_sdwdate.conf
}}

'''5.''' Paste.

{{CodeSelect|code=
## Enable offline mode.
## Disable Debian default pool.
## Which is configured in /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
## Does not work.
#pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org offline

## Open the refclock unix domain socket.
## Tested. This is functional. When running "chronyc sources"
## the socket is shown. Versus without the following line, the
## socket is not shown.
refclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock
}}

'''6.''' Save and exit.

'''7.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/chrony/chrony.conf
}}

Out-comment or delete the following line.

<pre>
pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
</pre>

Non-ideal. It would be nicer if offline mode configuration could be done with a drop-in snippet in folder <code>/etc/chrony/conf.d</code>, but this might not be possible.

'''8.''' Save and exit.

'''9.''' Restart chrony.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl restart chrony
}}

'''10.''' No need to restart chronyd. <ref>
Since it is just an alias in <code>/lib/systemd/systemchrony.service</code>.

<pre>
Alias=chronyd.service
</pre>
</ref>

'''11.''' Check if the unix domain socket file <code>/var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock</code> exists.

{{CodeSelect|code=
ls /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock
}}

'''12.''' Watch chrony journal log.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo journalctl -f -u chrony
}}

'''13.''' Verify that the unix domain socket driver is the only time source.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chronyc sources
}}

Expected printout:

<pre>
MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
===============================================================================
#? SOC0                          0   4     0     -     +0ns[   +0ns] +/-    0ns
</pre>

'''14.''' chronyc

Might be helpful during development.

{{CodeSelect|code=
chronyc
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
chronyc help
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
chronyc tracking
}}

'''15.''' See man pages.

* https://manpages.debian.org/chronyd
* https://manpages.debian.org/chronyc
* https://manpages.debian.org/chrony.conf

'''16.''' GNU date usage examples:

Might be useful during development.

To show the current time in unixtime format:

{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc "+%s"
}}

Expected printout:

<pre>
1654420510
</pre>

To convert a specific time/date to unixtime, use:

{{CodeSelect|code=
date --utc "+%s" --date "Sun 05 Jun 2022 09:22:28 AM UTC"
}}

Expected printout:

<pre>
1654420948
</pre>

'''17.''' TODO: task

Write a python3.9 or bash script that expects unixtime and writes it into the unix domain socket file <code>/var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock</code>.

interface draft, TODO:

{{CodeSelect|code=
./unixtime-to-chrony-socket 1654420510
}}

Or if the protocol also supports nanoseconds:

{{CodeSelect|code=
./unixtime-to-chrony-socket 1654420510.864804506
}}

How can we write messages to the unix domain socket file?

maybe https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117037/how-to-send-data-to-a-serial-port-and-see-any-answer

does not work

== Information ==
Testing if chrony is really in "offline mode" is not trivial. <code>pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org offline</code> did not work.

chrony needed 7 minutes between its start and showing that it is still communicating with remote time servers.

= Fingerprinting versus Security =
An optimization problem. There are conflicting goals.

* goal: Saving remote server resources &rarr; implementation: use <code>HEAD</code> (implemented)
** (similar to <code>curl --head HEAD</code>)
** is what sdwdate uses.
** [https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5924 Tails discussed using <code>GET</code> instead of <code>HEAD</code> for Tails <code>htpdate</code> but rejected that.]
* goal: Fingerprinting resistance at the remote server level &rarr; implementation: Hide outdated user agent version numbers (not implemented)
** similar to <code>--user-agent curl</code> or even a fake user agent.
** Disadvantage: this user agent may make use really unique.
** Hiding version numbers might not help with security either. If a user runs a vulnerable version, an adversary could try every exploit independent of the user agent version. The only solution is timely software upgrades by the user.
** [https://lists.autistici.org/thread/20121015.131424.1e9070fd.gl.html#i20121015.131424.1e9070fd Tails-dev - Faking htpdate user agent worth it?]
* goal: Maximization of security of sdwdate (implemented) &rarr; implementation: use the most remote code execution resistant backend (such as <code>curl</code> vs full web browser vs python3 requests) for <code>url_to_unixtime</code>
** Use python3 requests (implemented in memory-safe python3) instead of curl (implemented in unsafe memory language C).
* goal: Maximization of fingerprinting resistance from the viewpoint of the remote server &rarr; implementation: emulate being a full browser by using selenium or similar. (not implemented)
** Convincingly emulating a browser is impossible. Changing the user agent is insufficient. The only way is to actually run a browser.
** Running a full browser inside sdwdate would mess up security. Also very difficult to implement. Running a full browser GUI with an invisible X server and then somehow extracting only the HTTP DATE header. Might also worsen sdwdate's web fingerprint since it would run any tracking script (e.g., Google Analytics) present on the remote server. Then also, which browser? Tor Browser + selenium? Keep that browser updated? Too complex.

A compromise had to be made. Priority goals were chosen: maximizing sdwdate security and saving remote server resources.

= sdwdate linux user account =

* sdwdate is a daemon designed to be executed by an init system.
* There is <u>no</u> hard dependency on systemd by sdwdate.
* Currently, there is only a systemd unit file in the sdwdate GitHub repository.
* Other systems could be supported in principle, but this is currently [[unsupported]] as no contributor has added that functionality.
** To support others, one would need to (at least minimally) port https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/sdwdate/tree/master/usr/lib/systemd/system to a different init system such as SysVinit.
* sdwdate is designed to run under the linux user account <code>sdwdate</code>.
* Running sdwdate as root is neither desired nor required.
* Thanks to systemd, sdwdate can benefit from systemd sandboxing, which would be unavailable if started manually with user privileges.
** Using Linux capabilities. Has <code>AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_TIME</code> and <code>CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_TIME</code>. Therefore, the linux user account <code>sdwdate</code> can set the time without root.
