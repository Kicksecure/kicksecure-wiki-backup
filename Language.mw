{{intro|
This wiki page provides information on how to change the system language in Kicksecure, as well as how to install additional languages and input methods.
}}
= Introduction =

The system language used in {{project_name_long}} is easily changed. The technical steps are identical to the Debian method because {{project_name_long}} is based on Debian GNU/Linux and LXQt. Users can also refer to Debian or LXQt upstream documentation. It is also easy to change the language in Firefox Browser (see further below). Native English speakers do not need to make any changes.

= System =

These instructions are sourced from the Debian wiki [https://wiki.debian.org/ChangeLanguage ChangeLanguage] and [https://wiki.debian.org/InputMethodBuster InputMethodBuster] entries.

== All Languages ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a terminal in {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

{{Open a product ws terminal}}

'''2.''' Check the language environment variable.

Run. <ref>The Debian wiki notes: <blockquote>First, you have to set EnvironmentVariables such as LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES to your local language. Usually LANG (or LC_ALL) is sufficient.</blockquote></ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
env {{!}} grep LANG
}}

The output should show.

<pre>LANG=en_US.UTF-8</pre>

'''3.''' Determine the code for your language and country.

Before re-configuring the locale to your local language it is necessary to identify the two letter code for your language and country:

* <u>Language</u>: the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code is found in the fourth column (639-1) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes here]. For example, Japanese is <code>ja</code>, Korean is <code>ko</code>, German is <code>de</code> and so on.
* <u>Country</u>: [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search this website] ("Country Codes") identifies country codes. For example, Japan is <code>JP</code>, Korea is <code>KR</code>, Germany is <code>DE</code> and so on.

It is now possible to combine these codes to determine the language to export. For example, Japanese is <code>ja_JP.UTF-8</code>, Korean is <code>ko_KR.UTF-8</code>, German is <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code> and so on.

'''4.''' Reconfigure locales.

Reconfigure locales with the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
}}

A window will prompt for the preferred the locale(s) to be made available. Select the preferred option(s) with the space bar -- multiple locales can be chosen.

'''5.''' Reboot {{project_name_workstation_short}}.

This is required for the changes to take effect.

}}

== Fonts ==

Depending on the locale, it may be necessary to install [https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts additional fonts] in {{project_name_workstation_short}} so characters present correctly system-wide

'''1.''' Platform specific notice.

* [[{{project_name_short}}|{{project_name_short}}]]: No special notice.
* [[{{q_project_name_short}}|{{q_project_name_short}}]]: In Template.

'''2.''' Font installation.

* [https://packages.debian.org/stable/fonts/ Debian stable fonts packages].
* TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF) fonts are generally recommended. These packages start with <code>fonts-</code>.
* For Korean fonts, [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/fff34595/ forums] contributor previously recommended the following additional packages: <code>fonts-unfonts-core</code> (Korean TrueType fonts) and <code>nabi</code> (Korean X input method). After restarting {{project_name_workstation_short}} and starting nabi, the Korean script should be available system-wide for writing and reading. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install fonts-unfonts-core
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install nabi
}}</ref>

For example to install Japanese TrueType fonts:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt update
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install fonts-noto-cjk
}}

== Input Method ==

The <code>ibus</code> package is not recommended in Kicksecure 18. It can interfere with both keyboard and mouse input in the default LXQt session. It is also non-trivial to configure. Most keyboard layouts are handled natively by labwc without issues.

Some languages (like Japanese) require an input method application to write in the language's usual script. <code>fcitx</code> is known to work. To set it up:

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Open a terminal in {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

{{Open a product ws terminal}}

'''2.''' Install <code>fcitx</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install fcitx
}}

'''3.''' Install an input method engine for your language. For Japanese, <code>fcitx-mozc</code> is known to work.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install fcitx-mozc
}}

'''4.''' Configure fcitx to autostart on login.

Run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
mkdir -p ~/.config/labwc
nano ~/.config/labwc/autostart
}}

Type in the following line at the end of the file:

{{CodeSelect|code=
fcitx
}}

Save with <code>Ctrl + S</code>, then exit with <code>Ctrl + X</code>.

'''5.''' Configure applications to use fcitx as an input method.

Run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
nano ~/.config/labwc/environment
}}

Type in the following lines at the end of the file:

{{CodeSelect|code=
XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
}}

'''6.''' Log out and log back in. You should see a keyboard icon in the system tray; this indicates that <code>fcitx</code> is running.

'''7.''' Right-click the <code>fcitx</code> icon in the system tray, and click <code>Configure</code>.

'''8.''' Click the <code>+</code> button in the lower-left corner of the window.

'''9.''' Uncheck <code>Only Show Current Language</code>.

'''10.''' Search for the input method you installed (note that this is NOT the same as the name of the language you want to write text in!). For instance, if you installed <code>fcitx-mozc</code>, search for <code>mozc</code> here.

'''11.''' Click the input method, then click <code>OK</code>.

'''12.''' Close the <code>fcitx</code> configuration window.

'''13.''' To switch between input methods, press <code>Ctrl + Space</code>. The newly chosen input method will be displayed on screen. Note that fcitx tracks input methods on a per-window basis. For example, if you have two Firefox windows open, and you switch to Japanese input via Mozc in one window, the other window will still be using an English (or other) input method.

'''14.''' Done.

Input method configuration is now complete.

= Firefox =

Using <u>one</u> of the methods below is sufficient to change the language in [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ Firefox].

== about:preferences Method ==

# Type <code>about:preferences</code> in the URL bar.
# Scroll down to the languages section and search for the preferred language: <code>Language</code> &rarr; <code>Search for more languages</code>
# Add the preferred language.
# Restart Firefox.
