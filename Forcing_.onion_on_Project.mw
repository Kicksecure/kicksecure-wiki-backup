* Consistent use of the {{project_name_long}} onion service affords several benefits. It provides alternative end-to-end encryption which is independent from [[SSL]] certificate authorities and the mainstream Domain Name System and it also reduces the load on Tor exit nodes.

The onion domain of {{project name long}} is <code>{{project_onion}}</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
{{project_onion}}

Or in machine readable format, here is a raw link that only shows the onion: {{Archive_link
|url=https://www.{{project_clearnet}}/w/index.php?title=Template:Project_onion&action=raw
|onion=http://www.{{project_onion}}/w/index.php?title=Template:Project_onion&action=raw

}}

To use <code>.onion</code> services when browsing {{project_name_long}}.org follow the links below to the {{project_name_long}} main page, homepage, forums, download page, phabricator site, or the {{project_name_long}} Debian repository.

Note that on a few occasions in the past it was not possible to log in to the {{project_name_long}} forums using the onion address. <ref>https://forums.whonix.org/t/onion-forum-broken/8870</ref> <ref>This suggests the {{project_name_long}} forums onion address could become (temporarily) inaccessible in the future.</ref>

== Requirements ==
* The user must have Tor Browser installed.
* A recent (non-ancient) Tor version. <ref>
v3 onion connections require Tor v3.2 or above.
