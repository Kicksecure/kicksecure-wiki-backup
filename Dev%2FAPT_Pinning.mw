Why we should avoid Debian APT Pinning
}}

= Summary =
Debian developers would literally hate this.

Okay for end users and sys admins, but not a solution for a Debian derivative.

= More Details =
Question:
[https://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2013/08/msg00004.html Can a package pull a another package from another repository to be added?]

* Had resulted to breakage in Qubes. See: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4443
* Debian bug [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=951315 linux-image-amd64 vs linux-headers-amd64 Debian buster-backports version mismatch bpo.2 vs bpo.3] shows that just enabling backports repository might lead to issues. In this example, breaking all kernel modules due to kernel image vs kernel headers version mismatch from backports packages.debian.org.
