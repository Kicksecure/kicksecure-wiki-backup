'''NOTE:''' The changes to qubes-builderv2 required to make this work have not yet been merged upstream. These instructions will not work at this time.

= Building the Template =

{{project_name_short}} has a Qubes OS template available that can be built and installed using <code>qubes-builderv2</code>. This allows Kicksecure to be installed into Qubes OS without the need for distribution morphing.

'''WARNING:''' The Kicksecure Qubes OS template is still in development and may be unstable or prone to issues. Use at your own risk.

== Setting up qubes-builderv2 ==

It is recommended to use a Fedora-based App Qube for building the Kicksecure template. This is because upstream Qubes uses Fedora-based App Qubes to build Qubes Templates.

Determine which Fedora template is used for the <code>default-dvm</code> DVM template. For the purposes of this document, we will assume it is <code>fedora-40-xfce</code>.

=== Installing dependencies ===

1. Launch a terminal in the <code>fedora-40-xfce</code> template.

2. Install all dependencies for <code>qubes-builderv2</code> into the template. The dependencies are listed at:

* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builderv2/blob/main/dependencies-fedora.txt
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builderv2/blob/main/dependencies-fedora-qubes-executor.txt

All packages from both lists must be installed.

3. Ensure <code>git</code> is installed by running the following command:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dnf install git
}}

4. Shut down the template once you have completed installing all dependencies.

=== Prepare App Qube ===

'''WARNING:''' It is not recommended to reuse an existing App Qube for running the template build. You will be transferring the built template to dom0 and installing it when you are complete. If the App Qube used for running the builder is compromised, the template may become compromised as well. Templates are simply RPM packages, meaning ''they can run arbitrary code as root during installation.'' This means that a compromised template can, and probably will, compromise dom0. To reduce the risk of this happening, you should use a fresh App Qube for the build process.

'''1.''' Create a new App Qube for running <code>qubes-builderv2</code>. You can name this qube anything you want; we will call it <code>work-qubesos</code> in this document. Ensure the Template is set to <code>fedora-40-xfce</code>. Using Qube Manager, set the private disk space for <code>work-qubesos</code> to something reasonably large. 32 GB should work.

'''2.''' Clone the <code>default-dvm</code> Template and name it <code>qubes-builder-dvm</code>. This DVM Template will be used for fetching and building code. Once the Template is cloned, adjust its settings with Qubes Manager and increase the private storage space to ''at least'' 30 GB (more is preferable). 

'''3.''' Once that's done, start a terminal in the <code>qubes-builder-dvm</code> '''Template''', then set it aside for use later.

'''4.''' Open a dom0 terminal and run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /etc/qubes/policy.d/50-qubesbuilder.policy
}}

Type the contents of https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builderv2/blob/main/rpc/policy/50-qubesbuilder.policy into this file. (Note: If you have chosen names other than <code>work-qubesos</code> or <code>qubes-builder-dvm</code> for your qubes, you must adjust this configuration file to specify the correct VM names.) Save your changes with <code>Ctrl+S</code> and exit with <code>Ctrl+X</code>.

'''5.''' In the still-running <code>qubes-builder-dvm</code> Template, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/builder /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d
}}

Then run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/builder.conf
}}

and type:

{{CodeSelect|code=
binds+=('/builder')
}}

into this file. Save and close the file when this is done.

'''6.''' Next, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo nano /rw/config/rc.local
}}

and add the command:

{{CodeSelect|code=
mount /builder -o dev,suid,remount
}}

to the file. Once this is done, shut down the Template.

'''7.''' In a dom0 terminal, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-prefs work-qubesos default_dispvm qubes-builder-dvm
}}

Once this is done, all configuration should be complete, and you are now ready to install and use <code>qubes-builderv2</code>.

=== Installing qubes-builderv2 ===

1. Ensure that <code>fedora-40-xfce</code>, <code>qubes-builder-dvm</code>, and <code>work-qubesos</code> are all shut down. This ensures that all changes made to the templates apply to any new AppVMs and DispVMs launched during the build process.

2. Start <code>work-qubesos</code> and open a terminal in it. Install and verify the authenticity of the Qubes Security Pack by following the instructions at https://www.qubes-os.org/security/pack/. This is necessary to verify the authenticity of the <code>qubes-builderv2</code> source code.

3. Clone the <code>qubes-builderv2</code> repository using:

{{CodeSelect|code=
git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builderv2.git
}}

4. Enter the cloned repository:

{{CodeSelect|code=
cd qubes-builderv2
}}

5. Verify the authenticity of the head commit's tag:

{{CodeSelect|code=
git tag -v $(git describe)
}}

The output of this command should indicate that the tag's signature is good and should NOT display any warnings. If warnings are displayed, you may have installed the Qubes Security Pack improperly (for example, by forgetting to install the Qubes Master Signing Key or failing to mark it as trusted). If you are told that a tag does not exist, the head commit hasn't been tagged by a Qubes OS developer, and you should use:

6. Back up one commit if a tag does not exist:

{{CodeSelect|code=
git checkout HEAD^
}}

Then try to verify the repository's authenticity again. If the signature comes back bad, the repository is corrupted (or compromised) and should be discarded immediately.

7. Create a new file named <code>builder.yml</code> under the <code>qubes-builderv2</code> directory, and fill it with the following contents:

<pre>
include:
  - example-configs/kicksecure.yml

qubes-release: r4.2
use-qubes-repo:
  version: 4.2
</pre>

8. To build the template, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo ./qb package fetch prep build && sudo ./qb -t kicksecure-17 template fetch prep build
}}

This will download the code needed to build the template and then build the template. If all goes well, the built template will be placed in folder:

<code>
qubes-builderv2/artifacts/templates/rpm
</code>

9. Copy the template RPM file to dom0:

<u>Note:</u> Substitute the real name of the RPM file (this name includes a timestamp and will thus be different for each build).

{{CodeSelect|code=
qvm-run --pass-io work-qubesos 'cat /home/user/qubes-builderv2/artifacts/templates/rpm/qubes-template-kicksecure...rpm' > qubes-template-kicksecure...rpm
}}

10. Install the template with:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qvm-template install --nogpgcheck ./qubes-template-kicksecure...rpm
}}

'''WARNING: This action can execute arbitrary code as root on dom0! Only do this if you fully trust the App Qube used to build this template!'''

11. You should now see a <code>kicksecure-17</code> template available in the application menu, under the "Templates" section.

= Known Issues =

Currently, the <code>user</code> account does not have sudo rights, not in the template and not in AppVMs based on the template. If you need to run commands as root, you should open a [[Root#Qubes_Root_Console|Qubes Root Console]] using <code>qvm-run</code>.

The Kicksecure repository will not be enabled by default. To fix this, get a root shell within the template, and run <code>repository-dist --enable</code>.

<code>qubes-core-agent-networking</code> is not pre-installed. As a result, AppVMs based on Kicksecure will have no Internet access. <code>apt</code> will still work inside of the template though. To resolve this, get a root shell within the template, and run <code>apt install qubes-core-agent-networking</code>.

<code>qubes-core-agent-thunar</code> is also not pre-installed, thus copying files from the Kicksecure AppVMs to other VMs will not work easily. This can be solved by installing it in the template. If Thunar's context menu still doesn't show inter-VM copying features after installing this, shut down the template and all AppVMs based on it, then boot a Kicksecure AppVM and run <code>sudo rm -rf ~/.config/Thunar</code>. Thunar should now show the correct buttons in this AppVM.

Icons seem to be missing from Thunar's context menu. There's likely an icon theme package missing.

There seem to be some missing fonts - view the Wikipedia home page in Firefox ESR and you'll see some characters fail to render properly.
