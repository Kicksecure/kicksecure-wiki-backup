= Introduction =
Implementation idea for a donations based Open Source business model.

<u>Status:</u> Stalled. No specific plans at this time.

related: [[Dev/Open Source Business Models|Open Source Business Models]]

= Donation Verification vs non-Verification =
* '''Verification:''' '''No,''' the actual donation status will not be verified. This is to avoid having to invent code that does that.
* '''honor based:''' '''Yes.'''
* '''fake donate:''' Will use be able to select "I donated already" without having actually having donated? '''Yes.'''

= Systray Options =
Left and/or right click menu:

* I donated already.
* I am eligible for an exemption.
* Remind me in 1 week.
* Remind me in 1 month.
* Close.

= Screenshot Issue =
TODO

* issue: If the user makes a screenshot, the systray icons should not look different for users who donated vs did not donate yet.
* solution: The systray would have an (invisible) countdown from 60 seconds to 0 seconds. Once 0 is reached, the systray terminates itself so it vanishes from the systray.

= Systray Left Click Action =
TODO

= Systray Right Click Action =
TODO

= Systray Hover Effect =
TODO

= Qubes Specific =
* In Qubes-Whonix:
** Undecided. Perhaps,
** show donations systray inside anon-whonix only to avoid duplicate systray icons.

= Non-Qubes-Whonix Specific =
* Avoid duplicate systray icons in different VMs.
** Only run in the default VM.
** Skip if running in a "[[Multiple Kicksecure|multiple VM]]". I.e. not the default VM but a VM with a different local internal IP different fro the default internal IP.
