= Introduction =

When software packages from Debian or {{project_name_long}} repositories are downloaded, prior to the installation of new packages or upgrades, the package repository sources default to the https transport protocol, which is [[SSL|non-ideal for security]]. Instead, experimental Tor onion services can be configured, which provides several security and privacy benefits: <ref>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-heart-apt-transport-tor-and-debian-onions</ref>

* The user cannot be uniquely targeted for malicious updates -- attackers are forced to attack everyone requesting the update.
* The package repository, or observers watching it, cannot track what programs are installed.
* The ISP cannot easily learn what packages are fetched.
* End-to-end authentication and encryption provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, like version downgrade attacks.

Be aware that enabling onion repositories may cause system updates to periodically fail due to their [https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-onions-by-default-due-to-unreliability/6650 unreliability]. If this becomes an issue, it is encouraged to [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Non-functional_Onion_Services|Re-enable Clearnet Repositories]] so packages can be updated.

If the term "comment" is unfamiliar, please follow [https://www.howtogeek.com/118389/how-to-comment-out-and-uncomment-lines-in-a-configuration-file/ this link] to learn how to comment / uncomment lines in a configuration file.

On this page, instructions are provided for onionizing sources on the [[#Debian|Debian]], [[#{{project_name_long}}|{{project_name_long}}]] APT sources.

= Onionize Debian Package Sources =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
}}

'''2.''' Uncomment the onionized Debian repositories.

Uncomment the following .onion mirrors and comment out (#) the corresponding https repositories (except the fasttrack repository).

{{CodeSelect|code=

}}

'''3.''' Save and exit.
}}

= Onionize {{project_name_long}} APT Sources =

Follow these steps to point the {{project_name_long}} <code>sources.list</code> file to the v3 onion mirror. See [[Project-APT-Repository#{{project_name_long}}_APT_Repository_Overview|{{project_name_short}} APT Repository overview]] for details on the four repository choices.

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list
}}

'''2.''' Uncomment the onionized {{project_name_long}} repository.

Uncomment the following .onion mirror and comment out (#) the corresponding https repository.

{{CodeSelect|code=
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] tor+http://deb.{{project_onion}} {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main contrib non-free
#deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] tor+http://deb.{{project_onion}} {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main contrib non-free

#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] tor+https://deb.{{project_clearnet}} {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main contrib non-free
#deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] tor+https://deb.{{project_clearnet}} {{Stable project version based on Debian codename}} main contrib non-free
}}

'''3.''' Save and exit.
}}

= Onionize Tor Project APT Sources =

For enhanced security, advanced users and testers can onionize Tor Project updates; see [[Tor_Versioning|Tor Versioning]] for further details.
