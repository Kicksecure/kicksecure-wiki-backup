If enough host RAM is available, ideally the virtual RAM setting of {{project_name_short}} should be increased to <code>2048</code> MB RAM. <ref>
This provides higher performance during upgrades and lowers the likelihood of [https://forums.whonix.org/t/swap-swap-file-whonix-gateway-freezing-during-apt-get-dist-upgrade-encrypted-swap-file-creator/8317 issues].
</ref> If it is infeasible to increase the virtual RAM setting, {{project_name_gateway_short}} will still function properly. <ref>
Although non-ideal, [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/swap-file-creator swap-file-creator] will create an encrypted swap file and the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/vm-swappiness-1-set-swapiness-to-lowest-setting-still-useful-swappiness-lowest/9278 system is configured to swap as little as possible].

== Change Keyboard Layout ==
{{mbox

| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] users can skip this section. <ref>
By default, Qubes VMs use the same keyboard layout as Qubes <code>dom0</code>.
</ref>
}}

If you are using a keyboard layout other than <code>qwerty</code> (US), consider changing the keyboard layout. Refer to the dedicated [[Keyboard Layout]] entry for further details.

== Test Keyboard Layout ==

* <code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Accessories</code> &rarr; <code>Mousepad</code>; or
* {{Open File

}}

Try typing the words <code>user</code>, <code>changeme</code> and <code>qwerty</code>. Try typing further words to ensure the desired keyboard layout is functional.

== Change Password ==
{{mbox

| text    = [[Qubes|{{q_project_name_short}}]] users can skip this section. <ref>
By default, Qubes does not require a password for superuser access.

<div class>
The user can set or change the password for account <code>user</code> in {{project_name_gateway_short}}, if this is useful for the user's threat model based on this [[Default_Passwords|default passwords information]].

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' [[#Change Keyboard Layout|Change Keyboard Layout]] if necessary.

'''2.''' Review [[#Test Keyboard Layout|Test Keyboard Layout]] before proceeding further.

'''3.''' Open a terminal (such as Xfce Terminal Emulator).

<code>Start menu</code> &rarr; <code>Applications</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Terminal</code>

'''4.''' Run a test command as <code>root</code> by using <code>sudo</code>.

Run. <ref name=pwd_change>
Type the command in the terminal and press <code><Enter></code>.
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemd-detect-virt
}}

'''5.''' Read the note below regarding the username and password.

{{Default_Passwords}}

'''6.''' Read the note below regarding the password change procedure.

When typing the password it will <u>not</u> appear on the screen, nor will the asterisk sign (<code>*</code>) be visible. It is necessary to type blindly and trust the procedure.

'''7.''' Change the account <code>user</code> (and <code>sudo</code>) password.

* To change the <code>user</code> ({{project_name_short}} default user account) password, run the following command. <ref name=pwd_change />
* This will also be the password when running <code>sudo</code> from Linux user account <code>user</code>. <ref>
* This is the usual Debian / <code>sudo</code> default and [[Unspecific|Unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].
</ref>
* Using [https://github.com/Kicksecure/usability-misc/blob/master/man/pwchange.8.ronn <code>pwchange</code>]. <ref>
* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/usability-misc/blob/master/usr/sbin/pwchange <code>/usr/sbin/pwchange</code>] source code.
* Alternatively, Debian standard command: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo passwd user
}}
</ref>

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo pwchange
}}

pwchange will prompt.

<pre>
What user's password do you want to change?
</pre>

Type <code>user</code> and then press <code><Enter></code>.

'''8.''' Root password.

No changes required. Optional, for details, see [[Root#Root_Account|root account in {{project_name_short}}]].

'''9.''' Done.

The procedure of changing passwords is complete.
}}
</div>

If issues appear when gaining root, consider using [[Root#dsudo_-_default_password_sudo|dsudo]].

Another option is to [[Recovery#Recovery_Mode|boot into recovery mode]] and change passwords there.

=== Auto Login ===

Based on the threat model, users might want to [[Desktop#Disable_Autologin|disable autologin]] after changing their password.

Be aware that requiring a password for [[login]] might protect against unsophisticated, simple access. However, an attacker with physical access and basic Linux knowledge can easily change the password if full disk encryption is not used. See also [[Protection Against Physical Attacks]].

It is strongly recommended to use [[Full Disk Encryption|full disk encryption (FDE)]] on the host {{os}}; otherwise, the system can be easily accessed via chroot. <ref>
https://wiki.debian.org/chroot

== Security Updates ==

Regularly check for security updates and apply them in a timely fashion; see [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|Operating System Updates]].

== How do I Check the Current {{project_name_short}} Version? ==

See <code>/etc/*_version</code>.

{{Open_a__product_gw_terminal}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat /etc/*_version
}}

Should show.

<code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}.1<br />
{{VersionShort}}</code>

The first line shows the version of the major and minor version of Debian. The second line shows the version of the derivative ({{project_name_short}}).
