<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> - Role-Based Boot Modes - Persistent User / Live user / Persistent sysmaint (system maintenance) and their use cases.

Security-Driven Design:

* Limited users can't access privilege escalation tools.
* <code>sysmaint</code> mode isolates system maintenance tasks from daily use.
* Transitioning between modes enforces a stricter security model.

= Introduction =

This page discusses different boot modes in the {{project_name_long}} operating system, aimed at improving security through role-based boot options. It describes modes like "Persistent User" for daily activities and "Persistent System Maintenance (sysmaint)" for updates, software installation, and full system control. The goal is to isolate user activities and reduce security risks by restricting what each boot mode can access and modify. The page also explains potential opt-outs for users who prefer [[unrestricted admin mode]].

These schemes are generic and work for both hosts and VMs. This applies to {{project_name_long}} and derivatives of {{project_name_long}}, such as {{whonix}}.

= Development Goals =
{{Anchor|Goals}}

These goals guide the boot modes implementation:

* [[Login spoofing|Defeat login spoofing]]
* [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]]
* [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation|Strong Linux User Account Isolation]]
* [[Noexec]]
* [[Verified Boot]]

= Grub Default Boot Menu Entries =

The default GRUB boot menu entries are:

* <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>
* <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance.)</code>

= Use Cases for the Different Boot Modes =

Common use cases tailored to the available boot modes:

* <code>PERSISTENT mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>:
** Ideal for browsing, email, chat, or running a pre-configured server.
** read-only <code>/usr</code>, <code>/etc</code>.
** read-write <code>/home</code>
** Verified Boot: enabled. (Planned.)
* <code>LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)</code>: Similar to Persistent User but without persistence.
* <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance..)</code>: Allows running <code>sudo apt install [package]</code>, editing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code>, and similar tasks. Reboot into USER mode afterward.
** read-write <code>/usr</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/home</code>
** Verified Boot: disabled

= Integration with Verified Boot =

When booting into PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT, [[Verified Boot|verified boot]] will be disabled for the purpose of updates, software installation, and system configuration. During shutdown, the checksums required for verified boot will be created.

When booting into USER, verified boot will be enabled for the purpose of improved security.

See also [[Verified_Boot#Verified_Boot_for_User_but_not_for_sysmaint|Verified Boot for User but not for sysmaint]].

'''<u>planned</u>''': Role-Based Boot Modes (<code>user</code> versus <code>sysmaint</code>) will be implemented first. Verified boot is an additional security feature that is planned to be implemented later.

= Opt-Out to Get the Same Behavior as Old {{project_name_short}} =
Users who wish "the old {{project_name_short}}" "with unrestricted <code>sudo</code> for user <code>user</code>" back, who don't want the

* <code>PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT (For system maintenance tasks.)</code>

boot option, could uninstall package <code>user-sysmaint-split</code>. It could be easily removed using [[Debian_Packages#dummy-dependency|<code>dummy-dependency</code>]]. (<code>dummy-dependency</code> is being used to avoid [[Debian Packages|issues with meta package removal]].)

This is documented on the [[unrestricted admin mode]] wiki page.

= Boot Modes Considered Too Unimportant to Be Added to GRUB Default Boot Menu =

'''Currently, we don’t see good use cases to include these modes as default, but user feedback could change this in the future.'''

* <code>LIVE mode SYSMAINT</code>

'''DIY Methods to Include These and Other Entries in the GRUB Boot Menu'''

{{IconSet|h2|A}} Files in the <code>/etc/grub.d/</code> folder could add these entries, but they could be non-executable by default. To opt-in, users could run <code>sudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/somenumber_name-of-boot-mode</code>.

{{IconSet|h2|B}} Users wanting custom entries can add them directly to the <code>/etc/grub.d/</code> folder or GRUB boot menu.

{{IconSet|h2|C}} Using GRUB boot menu editing (key <code>e</code>) at boot, kernel parameters can be adjusted for any combination.

= /etc/grub.d File Names =

Details about <code>/etc/grub.d</code> files:

<pre>
filename                                     purpose
---------------------------------------      -----------------------------
/etc/grub.d/10_linux                         PERSISTENT mode USER
/etc/grub.d/11_linux_live                    LIVE mode USER
/etc/grub.d/12_linux_sysmaint                PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT
</pre>

Files should remain in lexical order below <code>/etc/grub.d/20_</code> to avoid conflicts with existing scripts.

= Design =
== Limited Environment ==

* '''Question:''' Why log in to a limited environment instead of a full desktop?
* '''Issues:''' A full desktop environment poses issues such as:
** '''Increased attack surface:''' Systemd units running could provide attack surface (e.g., long-running file downloads/uploads).
** '''Application exposure:''' The start menu could offer access to applications like Firefox, which could increase risk.

== Implementation ==

* '''Systemd target:''' <code>sysmaint-boot.target</code>, a systemd target similar to single user mode (kernel parameter <code>single</code>).
* '''Minimal services:''' Start only minimal services when booting into sysmaint mode (<code>sysmaint-boot.target</code>).
* '''Systemd unit:''' [https://github.com/Kicksecure/user-sysmaint-split/blob/master/usr/lib/systemd/system/sysmaint-boot.service sysmaint-boot.service], configured similarly to systemd <code>ConditionKernelCommandLine=boot-role=sysmaint</code>.

== No Access to Privilege Escalation Tools for Limited Accounts ==
{{Anchor|No Access to Privilege Escalation Tools for Limited Users}}

There are conceptually two groups of accounts, privileged accounts and limited accounts.

Privileged accounts:

* <code>root</code>
* <code>sysmaint</code>

Limited accounts:

* <code>user</code>
* <code>nginx</code>
* <code>mysql</code>
* <code>sdwdate</code>
* <code>ntp</code>
* Not a member of groups <code>root</code>, <code>sudo</code>, or <code>wheel</code>.
* etc.

Limited Linux accounts such as accounts "<code>user</code>" no longer have access to any of the following Privilege Escalation Tools applications:

* <code>sudo</code>
* <code>su</code>
* <code>doas</code>
* <code>pkexec</code>

This is because Privilege Escalation Tools are SUID applications, which can be a security risk for local privilege escalation (such as from account <code>user</code> to root). SUID related risks are elaborated on the [[SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener]] wiki page.

<u>Prerequisite Knowledge:</u>

* Linux file system permission basics.
* <code>owner</code> (<code>u</code>)
* <code>group</code> (<code>g</code>)
* <code>others</code> (<code>o</code>) (public)
* <code>read</code> (<code>r</code>)
* <code>write</code> (<code>w</code>)
* <code>execute</code> (<code>x</code>)

<u>Comparison:</u>

'''Debian:''' Privilege Escalation Tools (such as <code>sudo</code> and similar programs) are, as per Debian default, owned by account <code>root</code> and group <code>root</code>. These can be <code>read</code> and <code>execute</code> by <code>owner</code>, <code>group</code>, and <code>others</code>. (<code>chmod 755</code>)

'''user-sysmaint-split:''' Privilege Escalation Tools are owned by group <code>sysmaint</code>. <code>others</code> (which includes limited account <code>user</code>) no longer have <code>read</code> or <code>execute</code> rights. (<code>chown root:sysmaint /usr/bin/sudo</code>; <code>chmod o-rw /usr/bin/sudo</code>; same for <code>/bin/sudo</code>)

Group      Yes    No     Yes

</pre>

<u>Implementation Plan:</u>

For this to happen, applications may no longer internally use <code>sudo</code> exceptions (e.g., <code>/etc/sudoers.d</code>). This is further detailed on the [[Dev/sudo]] page.

== user group sudo membership ==
Should <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> postinst "<code>run_once</code>" <code>sudo delgroup user sudo</code>? No, not needed.

Limited account "<code>user</code>" can safely safely stay a member of group <code>sudo</code> by default thanks to [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#No_Access_to_Privilege_Escalation_Tools_for_Limited_Accounts|No Access to Privilege Escalation Tools for Limited Accounts]]. This simplifies testing and the process of users wishing to go back to [[unrestricted admin mode]].

== Qubes Support ==
Package <code>qubes-core-agent-passwordless-root</code> will be no longer installed by default in [[Qubes|Kicksecure for Qubes]].

For administrative actions, users can use a [[Root#Qubes_Root_Console|Qubes Root Console]].

= Remaining Issues =
== Fast User Switching ==
[[Sysmaint|sysmaint - System Maintenance User]] documentation chapter [[Sysmaint#Fast_User_Switching|Fast User Switching]] explains, that

{{quotation|
|quote=
It is not possible to switch from account <code>user</code> to <code>sysmaint</code> using:

* Start Menu &rarr; logout
* Start Menu &rarr; switch user
}}

This is a security feature. This is to mitigate [[login spoofing]] attacks and to to prevent [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|<code>sudo</code> password sniffing]].

The best-case potentially realistic scenario for fast user switching from account <code>user</code> to <code>sysmaint</code> - in theory - would be:

'''1.''' Learn about [[SysRq]].

'''2.''' Logout with "save session" as <code>user</code>. This means saving the session to disk and allowing it to be resumed, but no processes must continue to run.

'''3.''' Use {{IconSet|keyboard|SysRq}} + {{IconSet|keyboard|k}} (Secure Access Key).

'''4.''' Login into <code>sysmaint</code>.

'''5.''' Perform system administration.

'''6.''' Logout of <code>sysmaint</code>.

'''7.''' Use {{IconSet|keyboard|SysRq}} + {{IconSet|keyboard|k}} (optional, just to establish the habit).

'''8.''' Resume the <code>user</code> session.

== Server Support ==

GRUB boot menus aren’t easily accessible on many servers. A solution for making these boot modes available on servers is yet to be determined. Booting a server into sysmaint mode with minimal services (such as SSH, but not web servers, etc.) might not be practical due to downtimes.

<code>user-sysmaint-split</code> will not be installed by default on servers. Meta package <code>kicksecure-host-xfce</code> will come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default but meta package <code>kicksecure-host-cli</code> won't.

Future work ideas:

* See the forum discussion: https://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-boot-modes-for-better-security-persistent-user-live-user-persistent-admin-persistent-superadmin-persistent-recovery-mode/7708/50
* A) User could create a file that requests booting into sysmaint mode next time.
** This file would have to be writable by an unprivileged user, this needs to be done carefully otherwise *any* unprivileged user can DoS the system by writing the sysmaint drop file when the administrator doesn't expect it, thus resulting in the next reboot causing unexpected downtime.
** What users should be able to write the sysmaint boot request file? Only <code>user</code>?
* B) Sysmaint mode would use a systemd unit drop-in to disable most systemd units, except SSH, etc.

== Usability ==
* '''Terminal application risks:''' 
** Ability to run applications like Firefox from the terminal emulator in sysmaint mode.

* '''Documentation access in sysmaint mode:'''
** '''Why read documentation in sysmaint mode?'''
*** Necessary for complex system maintenance tasks.
*** For online searches or resolving issues.
*** Using AI assistants or posting on forums.

* '''Offline documentation:'''
** [[Offline Documentation|Offline documentation]] is helpful but insufficient since it often links extensively to upstream resources.
** Users are encouraged to refer to online documentation whenever possible (upstream resources).

* '''Alternatives:'''
** '''Separate computer:''' Ideally, such tasks should be performed on a separate computer.
** '''Virtual machine (VM):''' A less ideal but safer option is to use a VM for such tasks.
*** If Verified Boot and A/B updates are implemented, a sandbox feature could be designed to boot the host OS itself in a VM using immutable images, enhancing safety.

= Rejected Alternative Implementations =
* '''Chroot-based solutions:''' 
** '''Complex and messy:''' Involves managing two systems for upgrades.
** '''Disk mounts challenges:''' Bootloader upgrades, encryption, LVM, RAID, and other configurations must be handled correctly.
** '''System updates:''' Maintaining two systems for updates is difficult.

* '''Single user mode (kernel parameter <code>single</code>):''' 
** Does not allow login to graphical targets.

* '''Policy-rcd solutions:''' 
** See: [https://packages.debian.org/policy-rcd-declarative-deny-all policy-rcd-declarative-deny-all].

* '''Start menu restrictions:'''
** Hide applications like Firefox when booting into sysmaint mode.
** '''Implementation difficulty:''' Desktop environment-specific changes are required.

* '''Systray indicator:''' 
** A system tray icon could display a sysmaint symbol to indicate the current mode.

* '''Warning popups:''' 
** When starting Firefox in sysmaint mode, a popup could warn users to avoid browsing the internet unless absolutely necessary.
