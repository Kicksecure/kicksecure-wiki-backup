| text    = 
<u>Issue</u>: VirtualBox might no longer support <code>VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly</code>. Settings set through <code>VBoxManage setextradata</code> are not officially supported and might be gone at some time such as now.
}}

'''2.''' Set the VM disks to read-only.

Follow these steps:

* Power off the virtual machine (VM).
* Set the disk to read-only.
** The name of the VM in the following example below is <code>{{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce</code>. It could be replaced with the name of any other VM such as <code>{{project_name_gateway_short}}-Xfce</code>.
** On the host command line, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly" 1
}}

'''3.''' Remove VirtualBox virtual DVD drive.

This is only required if the VM has a virtual DVD drive. It is not required in {{project_name_short}} version <code>15.0.1.2.7</code> and above since it no longer comes with a virtual DVD drive by default. See footnote for a {{project_name_short}} build version lower than <code>15.0.1.2.7</code>. <ref>
{{VirtualBox_DVD_Remove}}

https://forums.whonix.org/t/no-longer-add-virtual-dvd-drive-to-vm-by-default/9337
</ref>

'''4.''' Launch the live system.

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "VM Live Mode-mode" will be visible. Select it and then press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Revert the read-only change.

To boot into normal mode again, run this command on the host to revert the change.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

The normal boot option can now be selected in the GRUB menu.

'''6.''' ''Optional:'' Re-add the virtual DVD.

Only when you need this; see footnotes. <ref>
{{VirtualBox_DVD_Add}}
</ref>

'''7.''' Done.

The process has been completed.

Troubleshooting: If the system does not boot, check the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version]] for {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox is in use.

= NTP =
== Disabling NTP ==
If ISP tampering with NTP is ever confirmed, users are advised to [[Time_Attacks#GNU.2FLinux_Host|disable NTP]] and manually update the host clock out-of-band. For example, a watch or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock atomic clock] can be used for this purpose. If the tampering is targeted and not a widescale attack, then the user already has much bigger problems to worry about than NTP; see [[Warning#Confirmation_Attacks|Confirmation Attacks]].

If following the advice above -- disabling NTP on the host and adjusting the clock out-of-band -- be aware that clearnet traffic might be easier to fingerprint. <ref>See the [[Fingerprint]] page to discover what fingerprinting means in this case.</ref> The reason is that it introduces a device issuing clearnet traffic (such as OS updates), but without the use of NTP. It is unknown how many people have NTP which is deactivated, broken, uninstalled, or never in fact installed in the first place. Also unknown is how many people are using alternative time synchronization methods such as authenticated NTP, [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing/ tails_htp], [https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate/ tlsdate], [[sdwdate]] or similar. However, search engine research suggests that very few people fall into both these categories.

== NTP Issues ==
The host system clock synchronization mechanism still uses unauthenticated NTP from a single source. This is not optimal, but there is no real solution to this problem. <ref>See Design: [[Dev/TimeSync]].</ref> A potential attack vector is created by this NTP behavior; the ISP and/or time server could either inadvertently or maliciously introduce a significant clock skew, or the host clock could simply malfunction.

If the host clock value is grossly inaccurate -- more than one hour in the past or more than 3 hours in future -- Tor cannot connect to the Tor network. <ref>In this case, Tor cannot verify the Tor consensus.</ref> This is easily solved by manually fixing the clock on the host, then powering the {{project_name_gateway_long}} off and on again.

Another side effect of a significantly inaccurate host clock concerns operating system (OS) updates and cryptographic verification on the host. Until the host clock is manually fixed, it may no longer be possible to download updates or verify SSL certificates correctly with the host browser.

Users should always check whether a host clock defect relates to an empty battery before assuming the ISP is tampering with NTP.

TODO

Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to set a random clock offset for {{q_project_name_long}} VM to prevent clock correlation attacks since it is [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T440 unsupported by Xen]. A related issue is [https://phabricator.whonix.org/T389 denying {{q_project_name_long}} access to "clocksource=xen"], which may not be possible without Linux kernel and/or Xen patches. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qubes-devel/aN3IOv6JmKw here].

VirtualBox has a feature to spoof the initial virtual hardware clock offset by setting the clock X milliseconds in the future or past. The syntax is outlined below.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset -<milliseconds>
VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset +<milliseconds>
}}

It is recommended to add a random delay within the following range.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset -60000
VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset +60000
}}

A spoofing example is below. Users should select their own unique and random values for both the past (-) and future (+) within the specified range. Different values should be used for each distinct VM (on the host).

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{project_name_gateway_short}}" --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{project_name_gateway_short}}" --biossystemtimeoffset +27931

VBoxManage modifyvm "{{project_name_workstation_long}}" --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
VBoxManage modifyvm "{{project_name_workstation_short}}" --biossystemtimeoffset +27931
}}

Apart from this small <code>biossystemtimeoffset</code>, a clock skew always degrades privacy. <ref><code>biossystemtimeoffset</code> is used to unlink the virtualizer's initial clock synchronization of the VM from the host clock.</ref> <ref>After powering on a VM, it initially synchronizes the VM clock with the host clock until {{project_name_short}} Timesync adjusts it.</ref>
