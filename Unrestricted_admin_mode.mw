{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be configured for unrestricted admin mode.'''

In this mode, traditional access to privilege escalation tools such as <code>sudo</code> and <code>pkexec</code> is possible for the {{project_name_short}} default limited account <code>user</code>.

Most other operating systems do not even call this "unrestricted admin mode" because they do not come with <code>sysmaint-user-split</code> by default. In such systems, unrestricted admin mode is implied. However, {{project_name_short}} provides the flexibility to switch between <code>sysmaint-user-split</code> and unrestricted admin mode depending on your needs.

Starting from {{project_name_short}} version <code>17.2.8.6</code> Xfce and above, {{project_name_short}} comes with [[sysmaint|<code>sysmaint-user-split</code>]] by default.

__FORCETOC__
= Uninstalling user-sysmaint-split and enabling Unrestricted Admin Mode =
This chapter documents how to disable <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> and to go back to unrestricted admin mode, where user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>.

'''Optional.''' Discouraged.

<u>Warning:</u> Reverting to unrestricted admin mode increases the risk of privilege escalation attacks and may weaken system security.

If <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> comes installed by default, the easiest to remove it is by using [[Debian_Packages#dummy-dependency|<code>dummy-dependency</code>]] to avoid meta package removal issues ([[Debian Packages]]).
