{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be configured for unrestricted admin mode.'''

In this mode, traditional access to privilege escalation tools such as <code>sudo</code> and <code>pkexec</code> is possible for the {{project_name_short}} default limited account <code>user</code>.

Most other operating systems do not even call this "unrestricted admin mode" because they do not come with <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> by default. In such systems, unrestricted admin mode is implied. However, {{project_name_short}} provides the flexibility to switch between <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> and unrestricted admin mode depending on your needs.

Starting from {{project_name_short}} version <code>TODO</code> Xfce and above, {{project_name_short}} comes with [[sysmaint|<code>user-sysmaint-split</code>]] by default.

__FORCETOC__
= Uninstalling user-sysmaint-split and Enabling Unrestricted Admin Mode =
This chapter documents how to disable <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> and revert to unrestricted admin mode, where the user <code>user</code> can use <code>sudo</code>.

'''Optional.''' Discouraged.

<u>Warning:</u> Reverting to unrestricted admin mode increases the risk of privilege escalation attacks and may weaken system security.

If <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> is installed by default, the easiest way to remove it is by using [[Debian_Packages#dummy-dependency|<code>dummy-dependency</code>]] to avoid meta-package removal issues ([[Debian Packages]]). <ref>
The <code>--purge</code> option is optional and not required in this case when using <code>dummy-dependency</code>, because <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> has been designed without configuration files in the <code>/etc</code> folder. Instead, <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> uses symlinks, which are deleted upon removal. This design ensures that a standard <code>apt remove user-sysmaint-split</code> will not result in unexpected functionality, such as parts of <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> (e.g., boot menu entries) still being active.

}}

= Impact =
This removes the sysmaint mode related [[Grub|GRUB]] boot menu modifications and reverts back to a "normal" boot menu.

Security impact?

= Optional Restrictions =
After removal the user can configure <code>sudo</code> and/or other privilege escalation tools etc as per usual.
