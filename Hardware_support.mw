The {{project_name_short}} project doesn't have a laboratory with all (classes) of different hardware. Specifically there is no stress testing with lower specifications hardware.

Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_short}} is based on Debian]], {{project_name_short}}'s hardware support is inherited from Debian project, which uses the Linux kernel by default.
