If more disk space is required for virtual hard disks, the good news is this is simple for {{project_name_short}} VMs. Nothing special because it is just another VM image. Any suggestions that are found for your virtualizer will similarly work for {{project_name_short}}. [[Self_Support_First_Policy|Self Support First Policy]] applies.

'''1.''' Back-up important data.

Either move important files via [[KVM#Shared_Folders|shared folders]] or make a full clone of VMs in each snapshot state in case something goes wrong.

'''2.''' Select your virtualizer.

'''3.''' On the host: Make a clone of all states of any existing virtual machine in case something goes wrong.

'''4.''' On the host: Delete all existing VM snapshots.

'''5.''' On the host: Grow the disk.

<u>Either,</u>

* '''A)''' Using the VirtualBox graphical user interface (GUI):

<code>VirtualBox</code> &rarr; <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Tools</code> &rarr; <code>Virtual Media Manager</code> &rarr; <code>select virtual hdd</code> &rarr; <code>adjust the size slider</code>

<u>or,</u>

* '''B)''' Using the command line. See footnote. <ref>
Find the folder of the virtual hdd.

Run the following command. Notes:

* Adjust the filename of the virtual hdd.
* Adjust <code>100000</code> to for example <code>200000</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage modifyhd "{{project_name_workstation_short}}-disk1.vdi" --resize 100000
}}
</ref>

'''6.''' Install a partitioning tool.

Note: No longer required for build version 17.3.9.2 and above.

Install a tool such as <code>gparted</code> that can grow the filesystem.

{{Install_Package|package=
gparted
}}

'''7.''' Start the partitioning tool.

Start a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|code=
lxsudo gparted
}}

'''8.''' Claim the new space.

* Increase the size of the filesystem.
* The user probably does not wish to create a new partition. Instead the exiting partition should be expanded.

'''9.''' Inside VM: Apply changes and shut down.

'''10.''' Done.

The procedure is complete.

'''3.''' On the host: Delete all existing snapshots.

'''4.''' On the host: Increase the disk size.

<code>1G</code> below should be replaced with the amount of memory to be added in gigabytes.

{{CodeSelect|code=
qemu-img resize vmdisk.img +1G
}}

'''5.''' Install GParted in {{project_name_workstation_long}}.

Note: No longer required for build version 17.3.9.2 and above.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo apt install gparted
}}

'''6.''' Resize the filesystem to claim the newly added space.

Note: No longer required for build version 17.3.9.2 and above.

* Increase the size of the filesystem.
* The user probably does not wish to create a new partition. Instead the exiting partition should be expanded.

'''7.''' Done.
