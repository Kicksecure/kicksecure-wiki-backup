= Options =
'''Choose one <u>or</u> multiple options.'''

'''A)''' Kicksecure Repositories Review

Look through the repositories provided by [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}} {{project_name_short}} on github] ([https://github.com/orgs/Kicksecure/repositories?q=&type=all&language=&sort=name sorted by name]). For example, [[security-misc]] can be installed without installing any packages that <code>Depends:</code> on <code>tor</code>.

Each repository has a rudimentary readme file which explains the functionality of the software package and how to install it.

'''B)''' Packages for Debian Hosts

Some packages are mentioned on the [[Packages for Debian Hosts]] wiki page.

'''C)''' Kicksecure Meta Packages Review

Alternatively, the user could look at [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/kicksecure-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control kicksecure-meta-packages <code>debian/control</code>] and choose meta packages which do not <code>Depends:</code> on <code>tor</code>. This isn't easy. As a package on which a meta pacakge <code>Depends:</code> might itself have a <code>Depends:</code> on <code>tor</code>.

The user would have to review the output of APT before proceeding to install to see if it includes <code>tor</code>.

'''D)''' Install a fake Tor package

1. fake <code>tor</code> already being installed

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/18192/how-to-fake-a-package-version-installed
* https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/HackingDependencies

2. Configure APT to update without Tor

3. [[#Update without Tor|Update without Tor]]

'''E)''' Mask the Tor service.

The user could attempt to prevent Tor from starting before installing Kicksecure. [[Untested]]!

1.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask tor
}}

2.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo systemctl mask tor@default
}}

3. [[#Update without Tor|Update without Tor]]

= Update without Tor =
The <code>tor+</code> prefix would need to be removed from <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>.

= Future =
This is mostly [[undocumented]]. No development progress should be expected as this is not the project focus. At very least not until a stable release of the {{project_name_short}} [[ISO]] becomes available.
