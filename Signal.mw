= Introduction =

[https://www.signal.org Signal] is a well-respected, free, open source, cross-platform encrypted messaging service. It supports individual and group messages (files, voice notes, images and video) as well as one-to-one voice and video calls. All communications are encrypted end-to-end for security, and mechanisms exist to independently verify the identity of contacts as well as the integrity of the data channel. The encryption keys are generated and stored at the endpoints (user devices), rather than by the servers. Both the client and server code is openly published, and the software is recommended by noted privacy advocates Edward Snowden and Bruce Schneier, among others. This is due to the strong architecture and limited metadata available in the ecosystem. <ref>

For additional Signal features, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#Features Wikipedia: Signal (software) - Features]
</ref> <ref>
[https://www.signal.org/blog/setback-in-the-outback/ Signal blog]:

<blockquote>
By design, Signal does not have a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list, location, user avatar, user profile name, group memberships, group titles, or group avatars. The end-to-end encrypted contents of every message and voice/video call are protected by keys that are entirely inaccessible to us. In most cases now we do not even have access to who is messaging whom.
</blockquote>

The desktop application supports one-to-one voice and video conversations. <ref>
https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.35.1
</ref>

This configuration allows the standalone Signal desktop client to link with the mobile device and send or receive messages from a laptop or desktop computer. <ref>

| text    = It is possible to install the [https://www.signal.org/blog/standalone-signal-desktop/ standalone Signal Desktop application version] for Linux in {{project_name_workstation_long}}. However, this configuration is <u>not</u> recommended because Signal requires the user provide a phone number for verification. <ref>
The number can be different from the device's SIM card; it can be a landline or VOIP number, so long as the user can receive the verification code and possesses a separate device to set up the software.

= Broken Metadata Protection =
Signal's metadata protection (who is communicating with whom) might be ineffective.

<blockquote>Hi, thank you for this thought provoking talk. You said so many things I disagree with it is tough to pick a question. But the one I want to ask is: The features that you have about private groups and sealed sender, those seem to be protecting data at rest for when the server is compromised the data that is on it is less useful to the attacker, but if the server is already compromised it is not really providing traffic analysis protection. Your metadata protection is effectively a pinky-promise oriented architecture and you have outsourced the keeping of the promise to a defense contractor owned by the richest man in the world; so my question is: How confident are you that Amazon is keeping the promises that you are making?</blockquote>

Amazon is proud of its cooperation with law enforcement and providing them with recordings from Amazon Ring, the doorbell snitch. It is hard to believe they do not collaborate with higher agencies such as the NSA of the security apparatus ladder.

= Prerequisites =

Signal must already be installed on your Android or iOS device. First follow the [https://signal.org/download download instructions] on the Signal homepage if required. <ref>Also see: [https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360008216551-Installing-Signal Installing Signal].</ref>

It is also recommended to create a separate {{project_name_workstation_short}} that is only used for Signal because these instructions require the enabling of the Ubuntu Xenial repository for the desktop client. <ref>
Common advice is to not mix repositories from related distributions like Ubuntu and Debian, since this can cause system instability.
</ref> The Signal developers do not maintain specific versions for other distributions, which is why Ubuntu is defaulted to.

However, the article details were later removed <ref>https://www.cellebrite.com/en/blog/cellebrites-new-solution-for-decrypting-the-signal-app/</ref> because it {{Twitter_link|moxie/status/1337434126186553345|was debunked by Moxie Marlinspike}} (co-founder and currently CEO of Signal Messenger), [https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1338859880384368641 Edward Snowden]([https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/1338859880384368641 Nitter]), and [https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1341358429873553408 Filippo Valsorda]([https://nitter.net/FiloSottile/status/1341358429873553408 Nitter]).

Note: cryptographer Bruce Schneier wrote an article about this issue in his blog entitled "Cellebrite Can Break Signal", but he later [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/cellebrite-can-break-signal.html apologized] for his erroneous post.
