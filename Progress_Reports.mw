== 2024-11-18 ==
=== Research ArchiveBox ===
Date: 2024-11-18

Found answers for each of the questions we had about ArchiveBox's functionality and installation sources, and recorded them under the ArchiveBox task in dev/todo.

=== More live-build work ===
Date: 2024-11-18

Fixed an issue where the kernel packages were hardcoded to the amd64 architecture in derivative-maker's live-build configuration.

Also attempted to add security mirror support to our version of live-build's mmdebstrap mode. This ended up failing because of multiple hurdles that were hit - one has to pass entire source lines to mmdebstrap in order for it to work in this kind of multi-mirror setup, but at the same time passing entire source lines to live-build as bootstrap mirrors causes it to misbehave badly when writing the chroot's sources.list file. This will require further development to make work right.

=== Debug and fix ISO build failure on Qubes OS ===
Date: 2024-11-18

Reproduced, debugged, fixed, and tested the fix for an issue that would result in ISO build failures on Qubes OS. (<code>/home</code> was being mounted with <code>nodev</code>, causing live-build to break.)

== 2024-11-17 ==
=== Review and clean up sdwdate's url_to_unixtime component ===
Date: 2024-11-17

Did a security review on <code>url_to_unixtime</code>. Found a few minor issues, documented them, also documented things that looked good. Forked sdwdate and pushed fixes for all fixable issues to my fork for review.

=== Test hardened JSON parsing in Tor Browser version detection ===
Date: 2024-11-17

Created and executed a full test plan for the Tor Browser version detection code. It is now ready for review.

<pre>
Test plan:

* [x] Install updated packages
* [x] Ensure Tor Browser is not installed
* [x] Run AnonDist. Finds correct version of Tor Browser and offers to install it?
* [x] Installation succeeds?
* [x] Update derivative-maker
* [x] Sync tb-updater and developer-meta-files with updated versions
* [x] Run `dm-packaging-helper-script pkg_tor_browser_version_update`. Correctly updated normal, alpha, and arm64 browser versions?
* [x] Run tb-updater unit test with `bash -x unit_test`. Passes?
</pre>

=== Harden JSON parsing in Tor Browser version detection (wip) ===
Date: 2024-11-17

Wrote code that made parsing JSON for Tor Browser version detection significantly safer. This still needs to be thoroughly tested and peer-reviewed, but it's working pretty decently so far. Implementation is documented on the dev/todo page.

=== Polish archiver script, begin mass link archival ===
Date: 2024-11-17

Added the last bit of needed polish to the archiver script (skipping archive.org Wayback Machine links), then started the script running. It may take a very long time to finish archiving everything, but it runs unattended and rate-limits itself, so it should work.

== 2024-11-16 ==
=== Write mass link archiver script ===
Date: 2024-11-16

Mostly finished a script that extracts all links from the Kicksecure and Whonix wikis, and archives them using archive.today if necessary. Uses mediawiki-shell's existing features to do link extraction. The script still needs to omit archive.org links and onion links, but that's about the only feature it's missing. The script intentionally operates very slowly, in order to avoid overloading the archive.today service.

=== Enhance mediawiki-link-to-archive with archive.today support ===
Date: 2024-11-16

Wrote the code needed for adding archive.today links to the Wiki, documented the intended behavior of the code, and documented followup steps that need to be done in order to deploy it.

=== Review kloak makefile enhancements ===
Date: 2024-11-16

Reviewed contributed enhancements to kloak's makefile, suggesting several changes and commenting on follow-up changes that would be required.

== 2024-11-15 ==
=== Research archive.today link protection operation ===
Date: 2024-11-15

Researched what steps would be needed to archive all pages linked to on the Kicksecure and Whonix wikis, and studied how to best add those links to the wikis. Added all researched info to dev/todo page, including adding a task for making the archive.today frontend capable of extracting the date and time of the last snapshot.

=== Redo Tor Browser version detection logic in dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-15

The logic for detecting Tor Browser versions that I originally wrote worked, but used a non-ideal method of version detection that was different than code already present in tb-updater. To resolve this, <code>pkg_tor_browser_version_update</code> now actually uses tb-updater's Tor Browser version detection code, giving us a single source of truth for both tools. Also fixed an easy-to-resolve Shellcheck issue while I was there.

=== Polish archive.today frontend, add to helper-scripts ===
Date: 2024-11-15

Finished the Python-based archive.today frontend. Both Tor and clearnet access work. Added to helper-scripts, deleted the now-obsolete repo used to share the WIP version with Patrick
.

== 2024-11-14 ==
=== Finish most of py-archive-today's features and publish on Github ===
Date: 2024-11-14

The tool is now capable of both archiving new URLs and searching for already archived ones. Unlike the Go frontend it draws inspiration from, it is able to detect when the page that is being archived is still being saved but isn't fully saved, and can wait until the page is fully saved, then spit out the final URL. This should make it significantly more useful.

=== Fix live-build crash due to apt-cacher-ng ===
Date: 2024-11-14

Finished creating a working fix for live-build crashing due to apt-cacher-ng HTTPS tunneling not being enabled. Required changes to repository-dist and derivative-maker. Fixes are published in my forks of both repos.

== 2024-11-13 ==
=== Start developing archive.today CLI frontend ===
Date: 2024-11-13

Began working on an archive.today CLI frontend written in Python. Python was chosen primarily due to its memory safety, the very low number of third-party dependencies needed to handle web requests and parsing, and the trustworthiness of the one third-party dependency that I did want to use (namely Requests). So far the documentation/specification for the tool is written, the CLI parser is done, and finding archived pages works. Tor support and the ability to archive new pages are next on the todo list.

=== Debug live-build crash due to apt-cacher-ng ===
Date: 2024-11-13

ISO builds are crashing due to a poor interaction between apt-cacher-ng and the sources.list files we ship in anon-apt-sources-list and repository-dist. I did quite a bit of research into how to resolve this, but was only able to determine three less-than-ideal solutions, which are documented on the dev/todo page at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/todo#live-build_-_build_broken_-_kicksecure_repository_apt-cacher-ng_configuration. Ultimately it looks like we'll probably end up having to work around this using live-build scripts, calamares, and debian-installer.

== 2024-11-12 ==
=== Test and review archive.today CLI frontend ===
Date: 2024-11-12

Tested the archive.today frontend, documented how to make it work and what it does so far. Also filed a feature request, and reviewed the code. So far it looks usable and appears to be safe, although the safety review is not complete yet.

=== Work on graphical-session.target bug in Qubes OS ===
Date: 2024-11-12

Attempted a fix, and researched possible solutions, including discussion with Marek.

== 2024-11-11 ==
=== Implemented Tor Browser version detection in dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-11

Reads from Tor's website and from Sourceforge to determine the latest versions of Tor Browser, Tor Browser Alpha, and Tor Browser ARM64. Automatically updates the tbb_hardcoded_version files from tb-updater with the retrieved info.

=== Research doas suitability for Kicksecure and Whonix ===
Date: 2024-11-11

Investigated whether doas was usable in Kicksecure, whether it would work around the sudo faillock bugs we were encountering, if it was possible to port our sudoers config to doas, and if possible, how much work it would be. Posted all results on the Whonix forums at https://forums.whonix.org/t/replace-sudo-with-doas/17482/18.
=== Start testing archive.is utility ===
Date: 2024-11-11

Successfully built the archive.is utility using Go 1.22 from bookworm-backports. Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish testing the utility for functionality as archive.today's archiver seems to not be working, even in a Firefox browser window. Will try again tomorrow most likely.

=== Make dm-check-unicode look nicer ===
Date: 2024-11-11

Split up the whitelisting pattern so that each file went on its own line, by converting the whitelist pattern string into an array and then assembling it into a pattern string using sed.

=== Fix debian.list file installation in derivative-maker live-build support ===
Date: 2024-11-11

Tested a fix for the installation of <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code> that did not require renaming the file. Fix worked, pushed.

== 2024-11-10 ==
=== Prepare to split security-misc into shared, desktop, and server packages ===
Date: 2024-11-10

As discussed at https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/issues/187. Looked at all files in security-misc, and categorized them into shared, desktop, and server categories, with rationale for each choice. Currently available for discussion at https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/splitting-security-misc-into-shared-desktop-and-server-packages/674, will implement once consensus is reached.

=== File Calamares feature request for specifying filesystem restrictions ===
Date: 2024-11-10

Filed a feature request to Calamares, requesting that distros be given the ability to restrict what filesystems are used at what mountpoints. This could be used to avoid the root-on-fat32 issue the user at https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-installation-cannot-set-timezone-link-creation-failed-target-usr-share-timezone-link-name-etc-localtime/652 ran into.

=== Make derivative-maker install live-build during build process ===
Date: 2024-11-10

Kicksecure now has a live-build fork and submodule in derivative-maker, but was not installing live-build automatically. The code for this has now been written and tested.

=== Refactor GRUB themes ===
Date: 2024-11-10

The GRUB themes we're using as a base had some font files shipped alongside that were difficult to audit. Some of them were also derived from the Ubuntu font family, who's license is considered non-free in Debian. There was also lots of duplicate code between the three GRUB themes for Kicksecure, Whonix-Gateway, and Whonix-Workstation. To resolve this, the GRUB themes were refactored, the Ubuntu font was replaced with Inter, and the custom GRUB fonts are generated at package build time from the originals already present in the Debian archive.

== 2024-11-09 ==
=== Finish testing refactored dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-09

Tested almost all features of dm-packaging-helper-script, with the exception of those that write to Git repositories. Fixed lots of bugs in the process. Ready for final review.

== 2024-11-08 ==
=== Finish refactoring dm-packaging-helper-script, start testing ===
Date: 2024-11-08

All functions of the original dm-packaging-helper-script are now implemented, with the exception of those that are outdated and did not need to be reimplemented. Currently testing all of the functions one by one, fixing bugs as I go. I've currently managed to at least somewhat test (and if necessary, repair) everything up to and including pkg_git_commit_readme. The current state of the refactor is now public as well.

=== Finish initial review of IPv6 support PRs ===
Date: 2024-11-08

Finished reviewing the changes in the IPv6 support PRs. Still need to test them and see how they work.

== 2024-11-07 ==
=== Begin reviewing IPv6 support PRs ===
Date: 2024-11-07

Reviewed some of the PRs mentioned in https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-ipv6-support/19893 for correctness and potential malicious behavior. Left several comments where things looked incorrect. So far I've reviewed the whonix-gw-network-conf, whonix-ws-network-conf, anon-gw-anonymizer-config, and whonix-firewall PRs. The only really strange commit I've seen so far is https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-firewall/pull/10/commits/4e202b11e84168d3415a4637768df6a692de6841, which references some IPv6 addresses that don't seem to be specified anywhere else.

=== Remove superfluous icons from GRUB themes ===
Date: 2024-11-07

In the interest of keeping a smaller attack surface and using less disk space, Patrick requested that I remove icons for other operating systems from the Kicksecure and Whonix GRUB themes. This is now done and tested.

=== Polish dummy-dependency script ===
Date: 2024-11-07

Discussed needed improvements with Patrick, implemented and tested them.

== 2024-11-06 ==
=== Further progress refactoring dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-06

Currently finished with all commands up to and including <code>pkg_need_version_bump_do</code>.

=== Write dummy-dependency script ===
Date: 2024-11-06

Wrote a script that dynamically generates, and optionally installs, dummy packages that can be used to work around dependency bugs in other packages. The script works in my tests. Also added the needed dependency on <code>equivs</code> to helper-scripts, and ensured helper-scripts built properly after my changes.

=== Implement and publish minor fixes for metapackages ===
Date: 2024-11-06

Published updates to kicksecure-meta-packages and anon-meta-packages, following all feedback from https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/metapackages-tweak-suggestions/663/2.

== 2024-11-05 ==
=== Debug apt solver problems with Recommends and Suggests ===
Date: 2024-11-05

Discussed issues with the behavior of apt recommends with Patrick. After much testing, a possible bug was discovered in which a suggests link could result in a package being incorrectly retained on the system. It remains to be seen whether this is reasonably possible to solve or not.

=== More dm-packaging-helper-script refactoring ===
Date: 2024-11-05

Currently have completed everything up to and including the <code>pkg_git_reset</code> function.

=== Suggest addition of a Weak-Depends field to debian/control ===
Date: 2024-11-05

Sent a detailed email to the debian-devel mailing list describing the issue of recommended packages pulling in too much (what I called "Recommended bloat") and how to solve it using Patrick's "Weak-Depends" suggestion.

=== Fix Kloak default values ===
Date: 2024-11-05

Fixed inconsistent info about default timeout and delay values in kloak. Also commented on the rationale for the exact manner in which the fix was done.

== 2024-11-04 ==
=== Continue refactoring dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-04

Finished framework code, began implementing the actual commands supported by the script. In particular, the <code>pkg_descr_creator</code>, <code>pkg_descr_merger</code>, <code>pkg_descr_merge_all</code>, and <code>internal_descr_writer</code> functions got a major overhaul, adding support for discrete Kicksecure and Whonix projects to the code (this functionality didn't exist before and was marked as "TODO" in the original implementation). All command functions from the top of the original script down to <code>pkg_compat_delete</code> are currently implemented. Still need to test everything, and there are lots more functions to copy over and adjust, but it's coming along nicely.

== 2024-11-03 ==
=== Review Whonix metapackages, post Kicksecure metapackage review on forums ===
Date: 2024-11-03

Posted the Kicksecure metapackage review for discussion. Also reviewed Whonix's metapackages briefly, only saw one potentially mis-located package, that being hunspell, which was already mentioned in the Kicksecure metapackage review and which is now documented in the review Github gist.

=== Finish Whonix and Kicksecure GRUB themes ===
Date: 2024-11-03

Finally have all of the details of the GRUB themes for Whonix and Kicksecure worked out. Branches of each repo that needed modifications are present in the dev/todo list and moved to the review queue.

== 2024-11-02 ==
=== Begin refactoring dm-packaging-helper-script ===
Date: 2024-11-02

Started the work of refactoring dm-packaging-helper-script. The end-goal is to make it easy to understand, more maintainable, and to remove the use of environment variables as a primary method of passing data to the script. Currently have most of the initialization and framework code laid down, and have gotten an understanding of how the existing script works in general. This is in preparation for adding tb-updater version update functionality to the script.

== 2024-11-01 ==
=== Polish Whonix GRUB themes ===
Date: 2024-11-01

Got both Whonix and Kicksecure GRUB themes looking and working properly. Had one final question for Patrick (do we want to support people switching between BIOS and UEFI modes), once that's answered I'll be able to make any final changes, then push to Git.

=== Document Super Grub2 Disk usage ===
Date: 2024-11-01

Documented how to install and use Super Grub2 Disk in the [[Broken Boot]] Wiki page. Documentation includes a description of how each boot mode works and when it should be used.

== 2024-10-31 ==
=== Review Kicksecure metapackages ===
Date: 2024-10-31

Reviewed the Kicksecure metapackages, noting down potential ways to improve on the existing structure. Also wrote a small script for visualizing dependency interactions, which may be handy for future review. I did not manage to review the Whonix metapackages yet, though I did mention some things related to Whonix in the review. The review itself can be seen here: https://gist.github.com/ArrayBolt3/1312aa401d0b7ade970210b3f526f9e8

=== Polish GRUB theme for Kicksecure ===
Date: 2024-10-31

Made the GRUB theme for Kicksecure look nice and work well. Most issues with the previous theming have been solved, with the only remaining issue being one that we may not care about.

=== Review Super Grub2 Disk functionality ===
Date: 2024-10-31

Tested Super Grub2 Disk's ability to boot installed Kicksecure systems. It works really well, for both encrypted and unencrypted installations. Did not test LVM. Might be a good idea to add info about this to the broken boot recovery page.

=== Research TCG DRTM ===
Date: 2024-10-31

Researched what a Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement is, how it is useful, and what implementations exist for x86 systems. Added relevant documentation and explanations to the confidential computing page.

== 2024-10-30 ==
=== Fix live-build dracut loopback boot bug ===
Date: 2024-10-30

Dracut requires the use of a different kernel parameter for loopback ISO booting than live-boot requires. Added support to live-build to set the parameter properly depending on the initramfs image type in use.

=== Investigate loopback.cfg boot support ===
Date: 2024-10-30

Investigated the feasibility of booting Kicksecure as a loopback ISO using SuperGrub2Disk. Ultimately, it looks like it can be made to work, but there are two hurdles that need to be resolved first, both of which are now documented in dev/todo. Next steps are to see if the dracut bug is still an issue in Trixie, and to make another live-build merge request.

=== Fix append-once and livecheck bugs ===
Date: 2024-10-30

Fixed a bug in append-once where multi-line string appends could fail if one of the lines in the multi-line chunk being appended already existed in the target. Also fixed a bug in livecheck where lsblk ran too early, resulting in the system erroneously reporting it was running in read-only mode on some boots.

== 2024-10-29 ==
=== Create prototype of GRUB theme for Whonix ===
Date: 2024-10-29

Tried porting the Kicksecure GRUB theme to Whonix. Ran into some issues, mainly with screen resolution on BIOS-based VirtualBox VMs. Also need to explore the creation of separate thems for Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation - I had initially not done this since I wasn't sure how to fit the extra info into the design of the GRUB theme. Prototype screenshots shared with Patrick.

=== Test live-build suitability for generating non-live images ===
Date: 2024-10-29

Experimented with using live-build with <code>--system normal --binary-image hdd</code> options for generating preinstalled, non-live systems. It's not as smooth of an experience as generating live images, but it is usable and potentially suitable for replacing grml-debootstrap. Recorded findings in the dev/todo page.

=== Create GRUB theme for Kicksecure ===
Date: 2024-10-29

After a conversation with Patrick, we decided to not use desktop-base as part of the implementation of the GRUB theme. Instead I took one of the GRUB themes linked in the Kicksecure GRUB theme task, modified it to work correctly with Kicksecure, and tested it. It may need another iteration of work since the theme will probably have distorted aspect ratio in some scenarios. (Edit: actually, this will definitely take another iteration of work because the BIOS GRUB theme will NOT work in VirtualBox. I set the resolution to 1280x960, which VirtualBox's graphics does not support as a "standard" resolution. 1024x768 works however.)

=== Report ISN security issue to IETF ===
Date: 2024-10-29

Wrote a vulnerability report and sent it. Report is at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tcpm/_T3Itdx06xzAgwcfe90KP_vTCq8/. This is intentionally public, as the IETF apparently handles their vulnerability reports publicly, as confirmed by the fact that someone with access to the non-public mailing list I CC'd on the message forwarded it to the mailing list after the email system apparently failed to deliver the message to the right mailing list.

== 2024-10-28 ==
=== Make livecheck only run detection once ===
Date: 2024-10-28

Added code to livecheck so that it would only run live mode detection once, and thereafter would use cached data about the system state. Also made the check interval way longer to reduce resource consumption.

=== Start generating desktop-base compliant branding ===
Date: 2024-10-28

This started as a mission to create a GRUB theme or GRUB background image for Kicksecure. Doing this revealed that the GRUB background image mechanism in Debian depended on a package called <code>desktop-base</code>, which turns out to be a theming/branding package that affects many different parts of Debian. It uses the Debian alternatives system to allow derivatives or vendors to override the branding as desired. It is undesirable to entirely supplant this package with Conflicts/Replaces, since that could theoretically cause breakage. However, pulling it in requires making a lot of Kicksecure-specific branding to override the Debian-specific bits. So far I have prepared GRUB background images, Kicksecure emblems, and multiple different variants of the logo, using Inkscape and GIMP. I stopped here however, as I realized I didn't know where some of the data I needed was (in particular I don't know where the default wallpaper in Kicksecure is stored), and I wasn't sure if <code>desktop-config-dist</code> was the right package to do it in.

=== Research proving issues with TCP ISNs ===
Date: 2024-10-28

Did research to determine how to prove that ISNs that integrate time values are dangerous. Shared with Patrick.

=== More improvements to Qubes event buffering support ===
Date: 2024-10-28

Implemented all requested changes from another reviewer. Ensured that the code still built properly, smoke-tested on Qubes OS R4.3, and submitted for another review.

=== Review kloak spec file for Fedora ===
Date: 2024-10-28

Ensured that a contributed spec file for Fedora was non-malicious. Also verified that the file successfully build a kloak RPM.

=== Fix remaining derivative-maker live-build patch issues, submit for review ===
Date: 2024-10-28

All known issues with derivative-maker live-build support have now been worked out. PR is marked as ready for review.

== 2024-10-27 ==
=== Test derivative-maker with live-build patch, add debian-installer support ===
Date: 2024-10-27

Tested a few other build modes of derivative-maker and ensured they worked properly even with the new code changes. After that, I worked on getting debian-installer rebranded and working properly, which proved to be a larger job than expected. In the end, things seem to be working very well, with only a few rough edges that need fixed up.

== 2024-10-26 ==
=== Fix bugs in derivative-maker live-build support ===
Date: 2024-10-26

Identified several issues with the new live-build support by comparing the list of all files on a VMs installed using old and new ISOs. All of these issues ended up having relatively simple fixes, which I have (mostly) verified work properly. At this point I just need to test things thoroughly, then live-build support should be ready for review

== 2024-10-25 ==
=== Add BTRFS support to live-config-dist ===
Date: 2024-10-25

Added BTRFS as an option on the Partitions screen, using Calamares configuration options in live-config-dist. Tested by installing a BTRFS-based installation of Kicksecure, worked for me. Added btrfs-progs as a dependency to kicksecure-recommended-cli since it's necessary for a BTRFS installation to work.

=== Release second prototype of derivative-maker live-build support ===
Date: 2024-10-25

The ISO build is now working without errors on my end, and after an audit of packages and files on old and new ISOs it looks like most major issues have been resolved. Forks of derivative-maker, live-build, dist-base-files, live-config-dist, and anon-apt-sources-list have been updated with most recent iteration of code.

=== Prepare VirtualBox link update script for review ===
Date: 2024-10-25

Replaced custom Python script with <code>str_replace</code>, added wiki editing capabilities, placed in developer-meta-files. Tested live by using https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Testpage&stable=0, code seemed to work as intended. Code has been given to Patrick to review, it should be tested more thoroughly before being deployed in production.

=== More polishing of derivative-maker live-build builds ===
Date: 2024-10-25

Finally got the ISO to build again. Detection of kernel parameters is done using <code>grub-mkconfig</code> rather than direct configuration file parsing, user creation is done by <code>dist-base-files</code> as previously, apt list files are correct and are handled by <code>anon-apt-sources-list</code> and <code>repository-dist</code>. Some changes were needed to individual packages, and there are still some issues (notably the user is created without sudo privileges due to a mistaken <code>rm</code> I added that was cleaning up a file too early). However, this is much closer, and I expect to be able to publish the code I have locally relatively soon.

== 2024-10-23 ==
=== Continue polishing derivative-maker live-build support ===
Date: 2024-10-23

Attempted to fix up kernel parameter autodetection at ISO build time, user account creation method, and apt configuration files. Also switched to multi-stage live-build rather than using <code>lb build</code> directly. I did not manage to get a working ISO before the day was over, however I made significant progress on it and believe that the revamped code should be able to produce working ISOs soon. Updated code will be published once it can successfully build an ISO.

=== Prototype automatic URL updating code for VBox links ===
Date: 2024-10-23

Wrote a prototype implementation for https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/todo#automate_VirtualBox_version_update_in_the_wiki that can read from VirtualBox's download page, read from the Wiki, determine if the Wiki's VBox URL is up-to-date, and update it if not. Currently it does not update the Wiki itself, but instead prints out the text it would write. Needs some internal polish (specifically it should use Kicksecure's <code>str_replace</code>) and needs the actual Wiki write functionality implemented, then it should be ready to use.

== 2024-10-22 ==
=== Polish derivative-maker live-build support ===
Date: 2024-10-22

Attempted to fix several issues with the live-build ISO prototype. This led to discovering a major bug in live-build that made it very difficult to set environment variables properly. Bug report at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1085869. Also discussed future live-build tasks and design with Patrick.

== 2024-10-21 ==
=== Finish derivative-maker live-build support prototype ===
Date: 2024-10-21

Got the live-build code to build an ISO without errors. Also fixed ISO GRUB screen branding. Remaining TODOs are noted down in https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/todo#ISO_-_port_to_live-build and related tasks. derivative-maker prototype code is located at https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/derivative-maker/tree/arraybolt3/live-build. live-build fork needed for build is located at https://salsa.debian.org/ArrayBolt3/live-build/-/tree/arraybolt3/lb-dracut?ref_type=heads. live-config-dist fork needed for installability is located at https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/live-config-dist/tree/arraybolt3/live-build.

Also tested building Kicksecure on Kicksecure using live-build. This worked perfectly - no changes needed to be made to the prototype code to allow the build system to function properly.

=== Integrate live-build into derivative-maker ===
Date: 2024-10-20

Added the ability for derivative-maker to run live-build to generate an ISO rather than using the usual ISO generation steps. I did not manage to push the derivative-maker changes to Git yet because I ran into a large number of bugs in the process (remote and local repo conflicts, random SIGPIPE errors making <code>true</code> exit non-zero, incompatibilities between my live-build local repo implementation and reprepro, etc). Most of these issues are now resolved. I fixed the local repo handler in live-build to work with reprepro repositories. Fix in commit https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/369/diffs?commit_id=eb1813e7bd211373060152a8bde140301576756c.

=== Polish configuration interface for Qubes OS event buffering ===
Date: 2024-10-20

At Marek's suggestion (https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-gui-daemon/pull/149#issuecomment-2421005914), I renamed <code>ebuf_max_delay</code> to <code>events_max_delay</code> in the configuration for qubes-gui-daemon. I also had to rebase my changes to qubes-gui-daemon to the tip of main since other code had been changed since I opened the PR. The code change was tested and verified to work.

This took significantly longer than expected because I had to fix updates on Qubes R4.3 (turns out they don't work right out of the box), then was unceremoniously dropped to a Dracut emergency shell upon reboot because apparently my Qubes installation's root filesystem decided to become slightly corrupted and needed a manual fsck to fix. I did manage to get the system back up-and-running thankfully, and did the work mentioned above once my system was back to functional.

=== Fix pam_faillock unlock on reboot or timeout ===
Date: 2024-10-19

Determined why pam_faillock was automatically resetting the tally on reboot and fixed it. Also kept it from resetting due to a timeout to the best of my ability (although due to limitations in pam_faillock this could not be done perfectly). Commit: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/security-misc/commit/690e8dd826d1cb39c0c12c03792781862cc2dd23

Note that this does NOT fix the issue where the use of passwordless sudo resets the tally. This may require assistance from upstream, and investigation into that is still ongoing.

== 2024-10-18 ==
=== Debug pam_faillock ===
Date: 2024-10-18

Kicksecure uses pam_faillock to provide bruteforcing protection for user account passwords. Unfortunately the existing PAM configuration allowed the tally and lock to get reset in multiple unintended ways. The root cause of this was determined and a proof-of-concept fix developed, however a deployable fix has not yet been determined. One of the problematic scenarios has a bug filed in linux-pam for it: https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues/842

=== Further improvements to Kicksecure live-build ===
Date: 2024-10-17

Wrote another patch for live-build and attempted to upstream it, this allows us to set <code>--error-on=any</code> on <code>apt update</code> calls within live-build. https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/371 Tested it and it appears to work. Also tested a bunch of additional options Patrick suggested using, which removed more unnecessary packages and improved the build process. Also documented that the custom fork of live-config-dist is no longer necessary.

== 2024-10-16 ==
=== Fix up package installation on Kicksecure live-build ===
Date: 2024-10-16

Fixed a couple of very annoying bugs in the live-build code for Kicksecure. There were a bunch of weird firmware files and display drivers getting installed incorrectly, which now no longer get installed, and the user had to explicitly confirm that they wanted to remove a bootloader package at one point during the build, which they now no longer get prompted for. I also got a merge request made for mmdebstrap support in live-build, which is visible here: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/370

Additionally, I dug up the old live-build code from derivative-maker and extracted the core <code>lb config</code> command from that. This may be useful for future work on live-build.

At this point the ISOs being produced using live-build are of a reasonably high quality, and I believe it is time to get the live-build fork I've been using integrated into Kicksecure's Git repos and start using it as the default framework for ISO file generation in derivative-maker.

=== Rework Qubes OS event buffering pull request ===

=== Create live-build local apt repo MR, more live-build debugging ===
Date: 2024-10-15

MR for local apt repo support in live-build: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/369

The reason for strange firmware files becoming installed appears to be because of a firmware installation routine in live-build operating as intended (though since I'm building with contrib and non-free repos it seems to be pulling in a bit more than ''expected''). Need some input on how to best handle that. I also diagnosed the reason for a "persistent mode" icon in the panel getting shifted over to the left, and created a patch here: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/desktop-config-dist/commit/6b0ec41a2ec75b11dbe1b50d9040fb56761bc583

=== Prepare X event buffering Qubes OS pull request for re-review ===
Date: 2024-10-15

Added a signed integer overflow check to a potentially vulnerable area of the PR's code, and gave the code a short stress-test and functionality test using vmonaco's device fingerprinting test, Reddit, and YouTube. Resolved all conversations from Marek's review of the X event buffering PR, and requested a re-review.

Implemented local apt repo support in live-build and pushed to Git on Debian Salsa (their GitLab instance). Sadly due to a glitch in Salsa, I was unable to open a merge request, and am awaiting a reply from the Salsa administrators. Also debugged issues with installed and omitted packages in the Kicksecure live-build project. Ultimately I wrote an email to the debian-live mailing list because of particular extra packages getting installed for no apparent reason: https://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2024/10/msg00007.html

=== Continue effort to pork Kicksecure to live-build ===
Date: 2024-10-13

Got significantly further than on 2024-10-10. The ISO now boots "out of the box", installs "out of the box", and for the most part looks and works like a standard Kicksecure ISO. Further development tasks are listed in the Github repo for the project at https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kicksecure-live-build.

=== Rework Qubes OS kloak patch ===
Date: 2024-10-11

The Qubes OS "X event buffering" patch at https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-gui-daemon/pull/149 was reviewed by a Qubes OS developer and several changes were requested. I got Qubes OS R4.3 installed on my primary development system, prepped it to build Qubes OS packages, and then did development and testing of the patch there. All requested changes were implemented, many of the comments were resolved (though I left some open for further discussion and review). The patch was also tested for functionality and appears to work well so far.

== 2024-10-10 ==
=== Begin effort to port Kicksecure to live-build ===
Date: 2024-10-10

I downloaded the latest live-build from https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build (using the tip of the master branch), and merged in https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/353 so as to enable use of dracut. I then created a Debian Sid chroot within my Kicksecure development virtual machine, and built and installed live-build within it. (live-build works surprisingly well inside a chroot environment.) I then researched live-build's features, as well as how to use it properly, and then worked on getting a basic Kicksecure-like ISO built using it.

Due to some oddities surrounding package installation, dracut repeatedly got uninstalled at some point during the build process, resulting in the build crashing later on. To fix this, I modified the code of live-build to avoid installing packages that were the source of the issue (namely live-config and live-boot). Additionally, the security-misc package was crashing the build because it was intentionally failing to install itself when it detected there were no users with sudo rights on the system. This ended up requiring a live-build hook to work around, which is not a desirable solution long-term. Quite a few very long builds had to be done before I finally got a working ISO, and I had to tweak the source code of live-build slightly, but I was successful at getting the ISO to both build and boot to a Kicksecure desktop. The source code of my live-build fork is at https://salsa.debian.org/ArrayBolt3/live-build/-/tree/arraybolt3/lb-dracut?ref_type=heads. The live-build configuration that finally worked somewhat for me is at https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kicksecure-live-build.

The finished ISO had quite a few problems:

* A generic-looking Debian live GRUB theme is shown on bootup.
* Due to a dracut bug in bookworm, the ISO will drop you to a dracut emergency shell if you attempt to boot it by just pressing "Enter" when prompted. You must press <code>e</code> to edit the boot options, and add <code>rd.live.overlay.overlayfs=1</code> to the end of the kernel command line to get the ISO to boot.
* When it does boot, you will be shown a very strange "Welcome to LXQt" window with no window decorations or anything. No window manager will be loaded.
* To get past this state, you have to press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to get to a TTY, then go to <code>/etc/lightdm</code> delete the <code>lightdm.conf.d</code> directory recursively, and edit <code>lightdm.conf</code> so it contains no uncommented autologin configuration. Then you have to run <code>sudo systemctl restart lightdm</code> and you are presented with a login greeter. At the greeter screen, click on the wrench logo in the panel at the top of the screen, and select an XFCE session to log into. Then log in with username "user" and password "live", and ''now'' you will see a Kicksecure desktop.
* The user is shown as being "Debian live user" in the application menu, with a prominent Debian logo applied. This is wrong.
* More software than expected ends up preinstalled, such as "Zutty" (Zero-cost Unicode Teletype, which somehow ends up becoming the default terminal), Tor Browser Donwloader, and lximage-qt for instance.
* Installation fails with a bootloader-related error, likely because we have a tweaked version of a bootloader install script that no longer applies, and my configuration doesn't preload the various GRUB versions into the on-ISO repository.
* The notifier in the upper-right corner of the screen showing which mode is active shows "Live" with a green light, rather than "ISO" with a disc icon.

Additionally, my test build used only remote packages, not locally built ones.

Next steps:

* Figure out a more elegant way of excluding bad packages other than modifying the source code of live-build. If modifications are absolutely necessary, add a blacklist feature and then use it.
* Determine why additional software is getting installed such as Zutty and bits of LXQt, and make it stop happening. (This is probably caused by package dependencies somehow.)
* Fix all the bugs.
* Add the ability to install packages from a local repo and test it.
* See if live-build can be used for building more than just live images. Some of the docs made it sound like it could be used for making preinstalled images, which could potentially be used for building VirtualBox and other hypervisor iamges using live-build too.
* Integrate live-build into derivative-maker (or the other way around?) so that source code cloning, package building, and ISO assembly can be done in one command like what is currently possible with derivative-maker.

=== tirdad functionality review ===
Date: 2024-10-07

Spent a good amount of time reviewing how tirdad worked, what its end-goal was, whether it succeeded in that end-goal or not, and also experimenting with various code changes such as simplified ISN generation, use of the kernel live patching API. Ultimately:

* It works. I was able to verify that its function hooks are called when a new TCP connection is made, and that the numbers it genrates are (pseudo)random.
* The internal functionality is very complex, seemingly needlessly so.
** The entire hotpatching mechanism is able to be swapped out with live patching quite easily, making the code dramatically simpler.
** The ISN generator is still integrating into its calculations connection info, similar to the original ISN generation code in the Linux kernel. But this is pointless - all that info is being integrated into a hash that is (by design) changed entirely every time a new connection is made, even if the source and destination ports are identical to what they were before. It's simpler, probably more secure, and potentially faster to just generate a random 32-bit number every time an ISN is generated.
** It should be relatively simple to implement a kernel command line option that simply makes all ISNs random 32-bit numbers. Such a patch has a pretty good likelihood of being accepted upstream due to its simplicity, though it may have to wait until the next kernel merge window opens.

=== Debug Pipewire audio failure with Intel audio ===
Date: 2024-10-01

Hoping to get some hint as to what was going wrong, I ran <code>pipewire</code>, <code>wireplumber</code>, and <code>pipewire-pulse</code> in a terminal with verbose log output. The first run was done before switching to Pulseaudio, then a second run was done after switching to Pulseaudio and then back to Pipewire (which as discussed previously somehow "fixes" the audio device). No meaningful differences were visible in the logs when comparing them with Meld.

Since AC97 is Virtualbox's default audio device for Linux, it's probably in our best interest to just stick with it. If we have to get emulated Intel audio to work, the next step is probably to add additional debugging code to Pipewire to see where things go wrong. It may also be worthwhile to try some non-Pulseaudio-based audio applications (i.e. something that uses JACK or ALSA directly) to see what happens. Sadly I corrupted my Whonix VM pretty badly messing with Pipewire packages, and the Whonix server is only letting me download the latest release of Whonix very slowly, so I wasn't able to get further than this.

=== Debug audio failure with >2 GB RAM ===
Date: 2024-09-27

Verified bug under Debian, Ubuntu, and Whonix.

Discovered while testing with Ubuntu that I could switch to pulseaudio, play audio briefly, then switch back to pipewire and everything would work. Somehow pulseaudio "initialized" the audio device and then pipewire was able to keep using it, I guess?

Tried Pipewire from bookworm-backports, issue did not resolve.

Initially I thought that Arch Linux did not have this issue because of https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965#5. With that in mind I looked at a diff between Arch Linux's Pipewire source code and Debian's Pipewire source code from backports. They were nearly identical with only a few non-suspicous-looking changes.

I then attempted to build Debian's Pipewire using build settings from Arch. This eventually worked, however installing the modded version of Pipewire did not resolve the problem.

As a sanity check, I then installed Arch Linux to see if the problem was reproducible there. It turned out it was reproducible, and the "initialize with pulseaudio first" hack also resolved the issue there.

Reported some of my findings at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965#10 and https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-intel-hd-audio-and-pipewire-incompatibility-audio-broken-after-increasing-ram-to-5-gb-no-sound-after-latest-updates-pipewire-bug/18211/27. I'm pretty sure this is an upstream bug at this point and will be hunting for it when I resume work on this.

=== Debug sysroot mount failure with dracut ===
Date: 2024-09-27

Tested use of live-build to make dracut-based live Debian images (building Trixie, Bookworm, and Bullseye images for testing). Things mostly worked, however the Bookworm image failed to boot with the same sysroot mount failure that Kicksecure is experiencing.

I then debugged the mount failure, and traced it to a difference between thw 90overlayfs module in Trixie and Bookworm combined with a missing feature in Bookworm. The full report is visible at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1082891.

Submitted fix discovered earlier at https://salsa.debian.org/debian/dracut/-/merge_requests/37

=== Investigate using dracut's upstream overlayfs feature ===
Date: 2024-09-26

Kicksecure currently uses a Debian-specific filesystem overlay module for "live mode". dracut has the same feature already existing upstream, so we would like to switch to it.

Tested switching to it on Kicksecure, for some reason the dracut-native overlayfs module was silently skipped over despite being set up properly. Tested again on Trixie, everything just worked. Upstream bug comment: https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/1565#issuecomment-2378133277

=== Investigate Pipewire audio issues ===
Date: 2024-09-26

Successfully reproduced Pipewire audio bug and device-level workaround (switching to AC97 audio) using Debian 13 (Testing). I didn't think it would be reproducible on Debian 13, but it was. Still need to investigate if Ubuntu has this problem. Left a comment at https://forums.whonix.org/t/port-from-pulseaudio-to-pipewire-for-audio-support/16879/49.

=== Resolve inability to boot encrypted Debian with dracut ===
Date: 2024-09-26

Bug link: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078792 If you install dracut on a Debian 13 (Testing) machine with unencrypted /boot and encrypted root, the system will fail to boot successfully upon next reboot.

The root cause of this turned out to be a missing runtime dependency in dracut. When using systemd within dracut (as Debian does by default), <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code> is necessary to unlock the disk. The dracut package does not depend on <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code>, and so the initrd is left with no way to decrypt the root partition. Adding <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code> to the dependencies of dracut before installation is enough to resolve the problem. (The result doesn't look very good, the user is left with a gray rectangle that doesn't even necessarily look like a text box, and there's no indication that they're supposed to type their passphrase, but at least the disk can be decrypted.)

Dracut gives no warnings when it generates an unusable initrd in this way, so I filed a bug report about it: https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/issues/684 I also commented on the existing Debian bug report with my findings: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078792#15 The fix for the packaging bug was submitted at https://salsa.debian.org/debian/dracut/-/merge_requests/37.

=== Switch to systemd-less dracut ===
Date: 2024-09-26

Dracut with systemd enabled has a module conflict leading to a scary error message about being unable to mount sysroot. This error message ultimately is harmless, but disturbing. See https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/iso-error-message-during-boot-mount-sysroot-special-device-liveos-rootfs-does-not-exist/418/4.

When researching how to resolve this, I found https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/1820#issuecomment-1133439023 which suggested omitting systemd from the dracut initramfs. After a couple of builds, I was able to do this and get a working Kicksecure ISO, however it now showed a (less scary) error message stating <code>switch_root: failed to unlink mnt: Directory not empty</code>. This turned out to be because Dracut mounts /dev/cdrom0 to /mnt/cdrom0 and then later tries to delete the directory without clearing it. After some more research, I wrote a dracut module that unmounted /mnt/cdrom0 and then rmdir'd /mnt/cdrom0, resolving the issue. This was tested and confirmed working. Code changes: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/derivative-maker/commit/894d0657b7cd69370d67759709fff166d469cc37

Ultimately it looks like we won't go with this approach as systemdless dracut has issues with encrypted systems on Trixie at least. Testing to see if this even happens on Trixie is planned, and if so we'll fix the root cause there.

=== Test for memory leaks in kloak ===
Date: 2024-09-26

ChatGPT pointed out some potential memory leak areas in kloak's source code. I looked at them and didn't see any particular issues. After checking the allocation and free behavior, I additionally compiled and ran kloak, then did typing tests and lots of mouse movements in order to stress test kloak. No significant memory usage was noticed indicative of a leak.

=== Investigate dom0 implementation of kloak in Qubes OS ===
Date: 2024-09-26

Read through https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8541, investigated qubes-gui-daemon's source code to determine how to implement kloak most effectively there and suggested a potential way forward (writing kloak's functionality into the GUI daemon). Comment at https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8541#issuecomment-2377325699 Implementing kloak within individual VMs does not seem practical in the long run since kloak can't run above the X server or compositor without special support from that server or compositor, and Qubes OS's Wayland compositor is intended to be implemented without support for kernel input devices. This means that kloak has to be placed at the GUI daemon layer, in which case it's most likely easiest to just make it part of the GUI daemon.

=== Harden Calamares encryption settings ===
Date: 2024-09-25

Discovered that encryption code is located in libkpmcore, which is a component of KDE and not something that can be easily changed in Calamares yet. Discussed obstacles and potential implementation strategies with Patrick, decided to try just getting more secure settings upstream first. KDE development discussion post: https://discuss.kde.org/t/making-libkpmcores-luks2-settings-more-secure/21764

=== Require user to make encryption choice explicit ===
Date: 2024-09-25

I originally started by trying to implement this from scratch to offer it as a feature request to upstream Calamares. As it turned out however, the feature already existed, and was able to be switched on by enabling a <code>preCheckEncryption</code> variable. Code change: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/live-config-dist/commit/410c62e664e7d1387e7c013867242838ff2cb912

While initially trying to implement this, I discovered a bug in Calamares where the user could check the "Encrypt system" checkbox and then proceed past the partitioning screen without entering a passphrase. I reported the issue upstream at https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2375 (along with a PR that should resolve it).

=== Update kloak readme ===

=== Add Qubes OS support to kloak ===
Date: 2024-09-25

Determined how to manually enable kloak on Qubes OS, documenting findings at https://forums.whonix.org/t/current-state-of-kloak/5605/111.

Getting this working by default needs orchestration, asked for advice from Qubes OS developers on how to proceed at https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1850#issuecomment-2374908358.

Disabled AddressSanitizer in kloak, it was unfortunately incompatible with Whonix's ASLR settings. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77672217/gcc-fsanitize-address-results-in-an-endless-loop-on-program-that-does-nothing. Code change: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kloak/commit/c3500fc38cea3d69c96765f6691688e4079ecd67

During work, discovered that Qubes OS and VirtualBox users may be distinguishable from other users based on typing and mouse movement patterns, potentially due to VM clock resolution. Recorded findings at https://forums.whonix.org/t/device-fingerprinting-of-vm-users-virtualbox-qubes-xen/20460.

Kloak development. Tested on both my physical machine (Kubuntu 24.04) and on a Whonix Workstation VM. Mouse click events were seen in the log output of kloak when running in verbose mode, and noticeable randomization was being applied even when kloak ran as a systemd service. Reported findings at https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/51#issuecomment-2371866583 and https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/51#issuecomment-2372382050.

=== Document kloak testing procedure ===
Date: 2024-09-24

Kloak development. Looked into potential applications that could be used to test kloak's effectiveness. Two hopeful-looking solutions were found on GitHub (https://github.com/johwconst/keystrokeDynamics2FA and https://github.com/goncalopp/keystroke_dynamics), however both of them proved to be prohibitively difficult to set up due to badly outdated Python code. TypingDNA appeared to be too privacy-invasive to recommend to other users. Settled on vmonaco's device fingerprinting test, and documented how to use it. Results can be seen at https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization#Defense_Testing.

=== Document how to clear apt-cacher-ng's cache ===
Date: 2024-09-24

Kloak development. Kicksecure's build process uses apt-cacher-ng. If a corrupted package is downloaded from Debian's mirrors, it will crash the current build due to a hash sum mismatch, then crash every subsequent build because the corrupted package will be stuck in the cache. After a couple hours of debugging what was happening, I traced it back to the cache, cleared it, got a successful ISO build after a little bit more fiddling, then documented my findings at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/VM#Build_repeatedly_errors_out_with_hash_sum_mismatch.

Date: 2024-09-24

Got an ISO to build properly after some fiddling, then tested xdg-desktop-portal autostart by:

* Installing xdg-desktop-portal
* Installing xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
* Running <code>systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal</code> and <code>systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</code> - this showed that the portal was NOT running yet
* Opening Firefox
* Clicking Menu > Settings > scroll to Files and Applications > click "Browse..." next to Downloads
* Running <code>systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal</code> and <code>systemctl --user status xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</code> while the portal window was shown - this showed that the portal WAS running

=== Avoid use of strncpy ===
Date: 2024-09-23

https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/66 mentioned wanting strncpy replaced with strlcpy for better security. However Linux's manpages warned about potential security issues with strlcpy (potential for DoS attacks if an attacker could control an input string) and performance issues, and recommended the use of a custom "strtcpy" function instead. This recommendation seemed reasonable, so I implemented it. Code changes: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kloak/commit/0c66a7b2da09cbabc5c4368a532ab43a0f34fbb8

=== Fix ARM support ===
Date: 2024-09-23

Kloak development. ARM support bug: https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/25 ARM support seemed to mostly "just work" on the Raspberry Pi 4B when compiling and running kloak directly, unsandboxed. However sandboxing revealed that the syscall filtering rules set in kloak's systemd unit were not correct and thus kloak was crashing. Determining the right syscalls for aarch64 (and then also for x86_64 on top of that) took a while, as did setting up the RPi as a development board, but it was doable. Code changes: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kloak/commit/d7f386dcdd25263eb9e7a7031b171fdec3d0d4d3 and https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kloak/commit/7fa9500c32f6560bf6ee7fe55438e27869601a0e

No AI-written code was integrated into kloak in the process, nor were any suggestions blindly implemented.

* 2022-01-03: Crypto address templates unified and Crypto address images unified

* 2021-12-31: Footer RandomNews. Solution: RandomNews template was not available in Footer2 widget (because: widget), so RandomNews was called in Footer2-Template. In template it is hidden by CSS and the whonix random news section in footer is filled with generic text. If JS is available RandomNews are moved to Footer (true HTML widget area)

* 2021-12-31: CodeSelect Improvements, Refinements #3. Green color and check mark if copy is clicked

**  Template [[Template:Archive_link]] and [[Widget:Archive_link]] and {{CustomRepo|Archive_link.css}} created: Similar to "Link to archive", but you can choose if you want an archive link, onion link or both

* 2021-12-21: Whonix Logo Format: discussed: jpeg and png specific use cases. And logo-text and logo delivered without padding

* 2021-12-21: Whonix Logo finished
** last revision of logo submitted and accepted
** export accordning to guidelines: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Logo
** no problems reported by reviewer

* 2021-12-20: mediawiki skin selection
** Whonix? -> Keeping mediawiki skin Foreground and adding CSS fixes later.

* 2021-12-19: Colored Platform Icons, 500px*500px

* 2021-12-13: discuss (easy, not important): cannot click inspect on other websites

* 2021-12-13 CSS very basic review. Answers for the following questions are desired:
** Is Whonix wiki currently using [[Mediawiki:Foreground.css]]? Yes.
** Is [[Mediawiki:Common.css]] currently in use? Also Yes.
** Advantages and disadvantages of merging these pages? -> No. Keep and [[Mediawiki:Common.css]] and [[Mediawiki:Foreground.css]] separate. Split into essentials (CSS for CodeSelect in [[Mediawiki:Common.css]]) and skin (Foreground) ([[Mediawiki:Foreground.css]]) specific.
