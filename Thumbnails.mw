{{intro|
Thumbnails are small preview images shown for files (for example, photos, PDFs, or videos) in the file manager. In {{project_name_short}}, thumbnails are disabled by default to reduce the risk from malicious files.

= Introduction =

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail Thumbnail] is a small preview image of a file (such as a picture, video, or document). Thumbnails make it easier to recognize and organize files in a folder.

= Security Implication =

To show thumbnails, the system must open and ''decode'' (parse) each file to create a preview. If a file is malicious or specially crafted, it can sometimes exploit bugs in the thumbnailing software or related libraries. In the worst case, this can lead to the attacker running code on your system (remote code execution), for example by chaining multiple steps such as: exploit decoder → gain user privileges → exploit local privilege escalation/sandbox escape. <ref>

== Mitigation ==

To mitigate these types of attack, the thumbnail feature is disabled by default in {{project_name_short}}.

Thumbnails are not the only feature that processes files automatically. [[File_indexing|File indexing]] services (used for search), such as [https://tracker.gnome.org/overview/ Tracker-Miner], can also parse files in the background and may be vulnerable in similar ways. For reference, see [[Dev/GNOME#1-Click_RCE_on_GNOME_(CVE-2023-43641)_in_file_indexing_service|1-Click RCE on GNOME (CVE-2023-43641) in file indexing service]]. At the time of writing there is no file indexing service by default in {{project_name_short}}.

= Enable Thumbnails Again =

If you want to enable thumbnails again, follow these steps:

* Click on File Manager → Edit → Preferences

* Click on Thumbnail → Tick Show thumbnails of files
