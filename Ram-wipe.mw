{{intro|
Wipe RAM at shutdown to prevent information extraction from memory.

ram-wipe is a software project designed to protect against RAM extraction attacks by erasing the contents of a computer's random access memory (RAM) when the system is shut down or restarted. This helps prevent attackers from recovering sensitive data that may have been temporarily stored in RAM.

ram-wipe is especially useful for organizations that work with confidential information and need an extra layer of security. By clearing the RAM during shutdown or reboot, ram-wipe reduces the risk of data theft through RAM extraction and improves overall system security.

= Introduction =
RAM extraction attacks have been a known method to steal information from computers since at least 2008. <ref>
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_boot_attack&oldid=249088610
</ref>
Many people assume that all data in RAM disappears as soon as a computer is turned off—but this isn’t always true. In some cases, the contents of RAM can remain for several seconds or even minutes after power loss.

Research by 3MDEB <ref name=3mdeb>
* [https://blog.3mdeb.com/2024/2024-12-13-ram-data-decay-research/ Research of RAM data remanence times]
* [https://blog.3mdeb.com/2025/2025-01-24-ram-data-decay-research-part2/ Research of RAM data remanence times, part 2]
* [https://blog.3mdeb.com/2025/2025-02-20-conclusions-from-ram-data-remanence-tests/ Conclusions from RAM data remanence tests]
</ref> confirms that this type of attack still works with modern RAM like DDR4 and DDR5, which are common in today’s computers. Sometimes RAM is wiped instantly after shutdown or power loss, but in many cases the contents can stay for a few seconds, or even minutes.

Since at least 2011, the Linux [[Live_Mode|live]] operating system [https://tails.boum.org/ Tails] has included a RAM wiping feature during shutdown. <ref>
https://web.archive.org/web/20110423165633/https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/
</ref>
(Live systems are run from USB sticks or DVDs.) However, Tails’ [https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/ documentation] explains that this feature has limitations.

Until recently, no other Linux distributions like Debian or Fedora included RAM wiping by default.

In 2023, the <code>ram-wipe</code> package was released as a new solution. It wipes RAM during Linux kernel reboot or shutdown sequences, helping prevent data from being recovered later.

<code>ram-wipe</code> works on Debian, {{Kicksecure}}, and possibly other Linux systems. It can also be adapted for other Linux-based setups or devices.

There is now a standalone [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/ram-wipe RAM wipe at shutdown tool (source code)] that has very few extra requirements.  
(These are called '''dependencies'''—other software that must be present for a program to work.)

The tool uses a '''dracut module'''—a plugin for the Dracut tool, which helps create the early environment used when the system boots.  
Many Linux distributions already include Dracut, so packaging <code>ram-wipe</code> for other systems is easier.

<code>ram-wipe</code> is free to use and Open Source. It is also Freedom Software, meaning anyone can study, modify, and share it under its license.

However, software-based RAM wiping (like <code>ram-wipe</code> or the feature in Tails) has a key limitation:  
It only works '''if the system shuts down properly'''. For example, it will not protect from some of the cold boot attacks when the device suddenly loses power (for example when the power supply is being unplugged suddenly), and the software execution flow is broken. In such case, <code>ram-wipe</code> will not have a chance to be launched.

For technical details on <code>ram-wipe</code> using <code>initramfs-tools</code> (a tool for building the early boot environment, similar to Dracut), see: [[Dev/RAM_Wipe#Status_of_initramfs-tools_Support|Status of initramfs-tools Support]].

= Installation of ram-wipe =
{{Testers-only}}
<!--
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt=Info]]
| text    =
This chapter is only required for users which aren't users of {{project_name_long}}. That is because ram-wipe is installed by default in {{project_name_long}}.
}}
-->

'''1.''' Platform specific notice.

* Debian: Debian comes with <code>initramfs-tools</code> by default.
* Kicksecure: Newer builds of {{project_name_short}} come with <code>dracut</code> by default.

'''2.''' Migrate to <code>dracut</code>. <ref>
Since ram-wipe is unavailable for <code>initramfs-tools</code> the user needs to migrate to <code>dracut</code>, the only supported initrd creator by ram-wipe.
</ref>

It's required to migrate to <code>dracut</code> if not already done. See instructions on the [[dracut]] wiki page to find out if dracut is already installed and to find instructions on how to install it.

'''3.''' Reboot.

This is to test if <code>dracut</code> is functional. If the system boots normally, then everything is okay.

'''4.''' Add {{project_name_short}} APT repository.

NOTE: Users of {{project_name_short}} can skip this step.

{{Box|text=
{{Project-APT-Repository-Add Easy}}
}}

'''5.''' Install <code>ram-wipe</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
ram-wipe
}}

'''6.''' Done.

The process of installing ram-wipe has been completed.

= Host vs VMs =
ram-wipe is useful on the host operating system but not so much inside a VM. See also [[Dev/RAM_Wipe#ram-wipe_Testing_inside_a_VM]].

= ram-wipe Known Issues =
* <code>Wipe mode is insecure (one pass with 0x00)</code>: This might be a textual output bug in <code>sdmem</code>. It might be inspired by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method Gutmann method], which is an algorithm for securely erasing the contents of computer hard disk drives. Gutmann, the inventor, said quote wikipedia:
** <blockquote>He said "In the time since this paper was published, some people have treated the 35-pass overwrite technique described in it more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques"</blockquote>
** No research papers that found that RAM has to be overwritten with more than one pass exist to the knowledge of the author.
** Several passes of RAM wipe would increase the reboot/shutdown time, have no documented benefit, increase the reboot time even more and therefore make this solution unusable.
** [https://github.com/cryptisk-grs/thc-secure-delete/issues/3#issuecomment-520754476 sdmem is unmaintained upstream?] <blockquote>Hi, this isn't a project that I'm actually maintaining, I put it up here for archiving purposes. Its old code and likely needs a lot of work. When I get around to doing some stuff on it, I'll work support for that in, but I can't say when that will be, sorry. Will keep the issue open though since its a good suggestion.</blockquote>
** If [https://memtest.org/ <code>memtest86+</code>] feature request [https://github.com/memtest86plus/memtest86plus/discussions/266 kexec into memtest86+ for RAM Wipe and reboot/poweroff - Cold Boot Attack Defense] would get implemented, this would provide a much better tool for wiping the RAM than <code>sdmem</code>.
* <code>[FAILED] Failed to start dracut pre-udev hook.</code>: This is happening because <code>sdmem</code> during the dracut pre-udev hook gets killed by Linux's out of memory (OOM) killer because it is using the maximum of available RAM.
* <code>sdmem invoked oom-killer</code>: similar to above.
* The output by <code>sdmem</code>, its progress meter and the OOM killing looks unnecessarily scary and is user unfriendly.
* In VirtualBox, newly kexec'd kernel that runs a second RAM wipe pass (2/2) does not show any output. This is non-ideal but only a small issue since ram-wipe does not need to be used inside VMs anyhow except for testing. The RAM wipe functionality during shutdown and after kexec can be confirmed using a [[Recovery#Serial_Console|serial console]]. On real hardware, this issue did not occur yet.
* Wiping the video RAM (the RAM of the graphics card) has not been implemented anywhere to the knowledge of the author. <ref>
[https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/5356 Erase video memory on shutdown]
</ref>
* ram-wipe security testing has yet to be done, see [[Dev/RAM_Wipe#Development_TODO|ram-wipe development TODO]]. Check back later.
* While dracut bug [https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/1888 dracut should unmount the root encrypted disk <code>cryptsetup luksClose</code> during shutdown] is independent from ram wipe, might affect negatively the RAM wiping process.
** Unmounting the root encrypted disk is important for RAM wipe at shutdown to make sure (or at least increase chances) of Linux releasing the LUKS disk encryption key from RAM.
** ram-wipe comes with [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/ram-wipe/blob/master/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/40cold-boot-attack-defense/wipe-ram.sh#L52-L68 code] to notify the user of this situation should it apply to the user's system.
** The user would be able to read <code>wipe-ram.sh: There are still mounted encrypted disks! RAM wipe incomplete!</code>.
** In result this means that the first RAM wipe pass (1/2) during poweroff/reboot might not wipe the root disk's full disk encryption key from RAM. Hopefully it would be wiped from RAM after kexec into a new kernel and the second RAM wipe pass (2/2).
** Obviously it would be much better if dracut would cleanly unmount the root encrypted disk.
** This will likely be fixed in Debian <code>trixie</code> thanks to <code>dracut-'''ng'''</code>.
