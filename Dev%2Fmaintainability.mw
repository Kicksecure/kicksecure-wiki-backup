{{intro|
This page discusses the practical limitations of implementing certain features within the Kicksecure project due to maintainability concerns.
}}

While the ambition to innovate is always present, some desired features may be unrealistic to implement due to various constraints. For instance, the initiative to [[Hardened-kernel|develop a hardened kernel]] has been stalled due to limited resources and the complexity of the task.

Kicksecure's development philosophy emphasizes maintainability and aligns with the following principles:

= The Issue of Open Source Funding =
One of the core challenges is the absence of a sustainable Open Source business model, as discussed in [[Dev/Open_Source_Business_Models|Open Source Business Models]]. The Kicksecure project, like many others, struggles to find a stable income stream to support even a small team of full-time developers.

= The High Cost of Custom Solutions =
Venturing into projects like maintaining a custom (hardened) kernel, for instance, is beyond what is considered manageable, given the current resource constraints. The history of security, privacy, and anonymity-focused operating systems is littered with projects that are no longer updated and can be considered abandoned:

* Liberté Linux
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonym.OS Anonym.OS]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_(operating_system) Subgraph OS]
* [https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/acknowledgments_and_similar_projects/index.en.html There is huge list of abandoned projects but only a very small list of active projects.]

This pattern is not exclusive to security-focused distributions; a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions quick review of Linux distributions] shows that many have been discontinued.

= Tails on Maintainability =
The Tails project shares similar views on the maintainability of Linux distributions. Their insights are well-regarded and align with Kicksecure's experiences:

= The Reality of Open Source Maintenance =
The discontinuation of Linux distributions is often attributed to various factors, including health issues, financial constraints, burnout, and the perception of insufficient impact or appreciation. Below are some testimonials from Open Source maintainers detailing their experiences:

= Conclusion =
In light of these challenges, to safeguard the sustainability of Kicksecure, features that demand high maintenance will not be pursued.
