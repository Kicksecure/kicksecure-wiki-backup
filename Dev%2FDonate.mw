{{intro|
The wiki page discusses the topic of donor recognition and lists non-profit organizations that do not have a list of donors or donor recognition with individual names. It also lists organizations with a donation threshold for recognition and provides examples. The page notes that this information is based on quick, superficial research and is not meant to criticize any particular nonprofit.
