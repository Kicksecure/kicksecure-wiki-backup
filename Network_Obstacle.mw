= Introduction =

{{project_name_long}} is a [[What_we_do|research]] and implementation project that is based on thousands of freely available software packages. You can learn more about the organizational structure [[Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems|here]].

The {{project_name_long}} project does not maintain Tor. Further, the reliance of the {{project_name_long}} platform on Tor does not imply developers are experts about the Tor software.

= Network Obstacle Examples =

Some users will experience "network obstacles" when using {{project_name_long}} because some internet service providers (ISPs) in various countries block/prevent access to the public Tor network. In this instance, The usage of [[Bridges]] is required, For example in China the Great Firewall automatically blocks connections to Tor thus it is necessary to obtain a bridge that works: <ref>https://support.torproject.org/censorship/#connecting-from-china</ref>
<blockquote>
# '''[https://support.torproject.org/censorship/what-is-snowflake/ Snowflake]:''' uses ephemeral proxies to connect to the Tor network.
# '''Private and unlisted obfs4 bridges:''' users will need to request a private bridge to frontdesk@torproject.org with the phrase "private bridge" in the subject of the email or, if they are tech-savvy, they can run their own [https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/ obfs4 bridge]. Bridges distributed by BridgeDB ([https://bridges.torproject.org/ HTTPS], email).
# '''meek-azure:''' it looks like you are browsing a Microsoft website instead of using Tor. However, because it has a bandwidth limitation, this option will be quite slow.</blockquote>

= Effect on {{project name long}} =

{{project name long}} need a working Tor connection because of:

* [[Update]]s are torified by default.
* [[sdwdate]]
* [[Onionizing Repositories]] (optional configuration)

Not having a working Tor on your machine will lead to time/clock and update/upgrade failure.
