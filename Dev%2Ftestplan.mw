Testing OS installation and Post Installation
}}

= Overview =

Testing the operating system after first release cycle (for testers) is an important phase in the development that no project which produces a complex software wont go through this phase. The testing phase contains alot of steps which varies and depend on the project you are testing.

= Testing the operating system before installation =

== Supported Installation Medium ==

This is depend on what the operating system is supporting, for Whonix and Kicksecure we have:

=== Libvirt ===

* KVM: .libvirt image installation for KVM (Only on GNU/Linux, preferably to be tested on Debian host and another common host used by user which is using latest/close to latest KVM version e.g Arch or Fedora or NixOS..etc).

=== OVA ===

* Virtualbox: .ova images installation for Virtualbox (Priority for Windows users with latest windows version and latest virtualbox version. Then after that for GNU/Linux users (Latest virtualbox version e.g from virtualbox repository on debian or any similar way to have latest version).

=== Qubes ===

* Qubes: From Qubes repository for both KS and Whonix.

=== ISO ===

.iso installation should be tested on all supported hypervisors, as it can have unexpected results e.g full black screen when booting .iso for installation inside Qubes HVM due to resolution issue <ref> [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10424 10424] [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10426 10426] </ref>.

== Before and During Installation ==

* Download URLs are all functional with proper speed <ref>Extra: Follow the website instructions (if updated and available) to check if everything is working the same or needs update.</ref>.

* Booting speed is normal.

* Legacy VS UEFI boot for OS.

* Secureboot and TPM (if supported/used).

=== For .iso specific ===
* No errors or fails or warnings or unexpected behavior during the boot of the .iso and if there are, make sure if they are normal/expected.
** Booting into live mode
** If live mode booted as expected, then check:
*** Internet connection (Wire/Ethernet and Wireless).
*** Browser Functional.
*** External Hard/Flash drive functional.
*** What other tools expected to be installed/functional (text editor or office or so).
** Booting into Installation mode
** If the installation mode booted as expected, then check:
*** Changing Language (and all expect options does show up and functional)
*** Changing Region/Location (and all expect options does show up and functional)
*** Changing/Adding Keyboard layout (and all expect options does show up and functional)
*** Changing numbers and dates format (and all expect options does show up and functional)
*** Partitioning Functional (automatic/default and manual)
*** Encryption functional (Note: Test install as well without encryption)
*** Other options if available like file system type ext4, Btrfs..etc.
** Check the installation process smoothness (expected time, errors..)

=== For hypervisor images specific ===
* Default settings for the images inside the hypervisor after importation are correct.


= Post Installation =

* The encryption is functional (.iso specific).
* No errors or fails or warnings during the boot of the OS and if there are, make sure if they are normal/expected.
* Make sure to:
** Boot into every single boot menu option available (live, User/Admin persistent or so).
** Any letter said to be pressed to enter certain functionality (changing in grub or so).
** All of the expected packages/apps exist and functional.
* Update and upgrade process working (with the expected repositories).
* There are no weird messages recorded in the journalctl from the boot time until the OS load.
* All of the changes pushed to the OS are functional e.g an app shouldnt show X message when opened.
* The OS can read external flash/hard drive.

=== For hypervisor specific ===

* Make sure to check:
** Share folder is functional.
** GPU pass through is functional.
