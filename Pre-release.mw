{{project_name_long}} is a research and implementation project.

Be wary of those confidently calling themselves all-knowing, all-perfect. {{project_name_long}} is an actively maintained research project making constant improvements -- no shortcomings are ever hidden from users.

The source code base of {{project_name_long}} has a history since 2012 and {{project_name_long}} as compilation and under its current name {{project_name_long}} was available for public use since 2018. See [[History]] for details.

Before <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website went online, {{project_name_long}} was hosted on a different website. <ref>
<pre>
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure

</ref> This was non-ideal from a usability perspective. The dedicated <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website went public in November 2021.

{{project_name_long}} refers to itself as pre-release for two reasons:

'''1.''' This wiki is a work in progress. Many links are broken and a lot of documentation has to be refined. The lack of documentation might make {{project_name_long}} more difficult to use.

'''2.''' A {{project_name_long}} ISO is not available yet.

"pre-release" does not imply "security issues".
