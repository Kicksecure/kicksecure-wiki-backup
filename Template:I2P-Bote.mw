[https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p-bote I2P-Bote] is a serverless, encrypted email plugin that uses [[I2P|I2P]] for anonymity. Messages are stored in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table distributed hash table (DHT)] for 100 days, during which the recipient is able to download them. Emails are automatically encrypted and digitally signed, which means only the intended recipient can read them and they cannot be forged by third parties.

To back up I2P-Bote data, copy the i2pbote folder inside the I2P config directory (''~/.i2p/i2pbote'' on Unix systems or ''/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config'' when running as a daemon).

Compartmentalize activities and only use the I2P-Bote/Susimail VM snapshot for this purpose. Generally, applications that run with a browser interface are vulnerable to a whole class of bugs, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery cross-site request forgery (CSRF)]. <ref>https://chaoswebs.net/blog/exploiting-I2P-Bote.html</ref> <ref>https://chaoswebs.net/blog/stealing-your-I2P-email.html</ref>
