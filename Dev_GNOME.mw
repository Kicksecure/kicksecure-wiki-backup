* <u>'''GNOME Website Extensions:'''</u> GNOME allows installing extensions via an <code>Install</code> button on its website. Example: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/ Dash to Panel extension]
** <u>Digital signature verification:</u> Does it perform digital software signature verification?
* <u>'''Security Risks in Default Installation:'''</u> The standard GNOME setup includes numerous features, which may lead to security vulnerabilities.
** <u>Anchor:</u> {{anchor|show=true|1-Click RCE on GNOME (CVE-2023-43641) in file indexing service}}
** <u>'''File Download Vulnerabilities:'''</u> Simple file downloads have, in the past, led to remote code execution.
** <u>'''Link Click Vulnerabilities:'''</u> Clicking a link on a website has, in the past, led to remote code execution.

= Reasons Against Using a Minimal Desktop Environment Without Its Bad Stuff =

While it might be theoretically possible to avoid GNOME's undesirable aspects by selectively using only core packages like the window manager and systray, this approach is not without notable drawbacks.

Selectively using GNOME components, such as the window manager and systray, while concurrently issuing warnings about other standard GNOME functionalities, creates contradictions and practical challenges. This methodology seems counterintuitive: utilizing only specific parts of GNOME (like the window manager and systray) while needing to add warnings and disclaimers against its standard, documented features in user documentation and support requests.

For example, GNOME's recommended method for installing the Clipboard Indicator involves visiting [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/ extensions.gnome.org Clipboard Indicator] and clicking 'Install'. However, this raises a question: what is the secure alternative that avoids browser interactions and includes digital software verification? As of this writing, this remains unclear.

For instance, consider a user query:

{{quotation
|quote=Is it safe to install [https://packages.debian.org/gnome-clocks gnome-clocks]?
|context=Hypothetical user support request.
}}

{{quotation
|quote=No, it is not recommended due to its dependency on [https://packages.debian.org/geoclue-2.0 geoclue-2.0]. This dependency not only expands the attack surface but also raises [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/geoclue/geoclue/-/issues/177 privacy concerns]. Currently, instructions to mitigate these risks remain [[undocumented]].
|context=Hypothetical reply.
}}

Such an approach would lead to inconsistency and confusion for users, undermining the practicality of using a minimal GNOME setup.

No comparable issues exist for LXQt. Users have the advantage of leveraging both Debian and LXQt documentation, along with resources from third parties, to customize and utilize LXQt effectively.

NOTE: As of Debian Trixie, the default Gnome version is Gnome 48 (kernel 6.12.73 as of this edit, 2/23/2026). Many if not all desktop extensions for Gnome (for Debian 13) are now listed as part of the 'main' stable Debian 13 Trixie repository. I checked Gnome extensions web page and at extensions dot gnome dot org it is still recommended to download through the website. They suggest some browser extension but I did not test that. I simply followed the links and proceeded to download a gnome extension .zip file the normal way any file would be downloaded in the Tor Browser. I scanned the .zip just to see if maybe there was a signature embedded (similar to how other files can be signed for example) that I could verify manually by pgp, but there was none apparent.

= Usability =

'''Systray Absence:''' By default, GNOME does not include a systray.

How can it be added?

* For typical GNOME users, the recommended method is to visit: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/ AppIndicator Support] and click the 'Install' button.
* Command line: For users who want to install from the command line, via packages.debian.org or from source code, while performing digital software signature verification: Unknown.
* Linux distributions: For distributions using a build script, the process remains unclear. ([[Dev/Derivative-Maker#Introduction|Clicking buttons is inappropriate for Linux distribution build scripts.]]) If a solution for the command line becomes available, it might also provide insight into this scenario.
