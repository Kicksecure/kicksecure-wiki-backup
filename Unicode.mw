== Unicode as a Security Risk ==
There are invisible characters that might be copied that can do malicious actions. This is a security risk for:

* '''A)''' <u>For users:</u> Commands copied and pasted into a terminal emulator.
* '''B)''' <u>For developers:</u> Introduction of invisible vulnerabilities or backdoors through source code contributions.

These adversarial encodings produce no visual artifacts probably in most editors and terminals.

<u>NOTE:</u> Not all unicode in files is necessarily malicious. Only some unicode characters in some files are suspicious or potentially malicious.

== Searching Files and Folders for Unicode ==
{{Anchor|Checking Files for Unicode}}
=== grep-find-unicode-wrapper ===

<code>grep-find-unicode-wrapper</code> <ref>
https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/bin/grep-find-unicode-wrapper
</ref> can help to check files for unicode.

'''Syntax for files:'''

<pre>
grep-find-unicode-wrapper /path/to/filename
</pre>

'''Example for files:'''

<u>Note:</u> The following example check file <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Replace <code>~/.bashrc</code> with the actual file to check.

{{CodeSelect|code=
grep-find-unicode-wrapper ~/.bashrc
}}

'''Syntax for folders:'''

<pre>
grep-find-unicode-wrapper -r /path/to/folder
</pre>

'''Example for folders:'''

<u>Note:</u> The following example check the user's home folder. Replace <code>~/</code> with a different folder if another folder should be checked.

{{CodeSelect|code=
grep-find-unicode-wrapper -r ~/
}}

'''Expected output:'''

* '''A)''' If no unicode has been found: None.
* '''B)''' If unicode has been found: All lines that include unicode.

'''Expected exit codes:'''

* '''A)''' If no unicode has been found: non-zero exit code.
* '''B)''' If unicode has been found: Exit code <code>0</code>.

'''Similarity with <code>grep</code>:'''

Since <code>grep-find-unicode-wrapper</code> is a wrapper around <code>grep</code>, output and exit codes are similar to <code>grep</code>.
