|-
! scope="row"| Backdoors
|
* Files on devices can be deleted if they were downloaded from sources competing with Apple companies. <br />
* Intentional backdoors allow remote root privileges, wipes and deletion of applications.
|-
! scope="row"| Design Flaws
|
* An insecure design allows execution of malicious code by applications and the extraction of messaging history.
|-
! scope="row"| Device Bricking
|
* Devices are bricked if fixed by an "unauthorized" repair shop. <br />
* Devices are bricked that were unlocked without permission.
|-
! scope="row"| Personal Information
|
* Biometric markers like fingerprints are used for device authorization. <br />
* Extensive personal information is sent to Apple servers, such as: <br />
** Automatic uploads of photos and videos used by certain applications; and <br />
** Unsaved documents and program files (without permission). <br />
* Search terms and location information are sent to Apple. <br />
* System files are scanned.
* OSX phones home with info about the Date, Time, Computer, ISP, City, State and Application Hash when any program is executed, by default. <ref>https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/</ref> <ref>https://appleterm.com/2020/10/20/macos-big-sur-firewalls-and-vpns/</ref>
|-
! scope="row"| User Control and Freedoms
|
* Allowable programs like media, political, bitcoin and health-focused applications, and games are censored. <br />
* Arbitrary limits are imposed on the use of software. <br />
* Digital restrictions mechanisms are imposed. <br />
* System upgrades are forced without consent. <br />
* Older versions of operating systems cannot be installed. <br />
* It is impossible to manually fix system security bugs that Apple have not addressed. <br />
* User interfaces are designed to make specific options hard to find and enable/disable.
