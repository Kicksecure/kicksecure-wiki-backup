__FORCETOC__
= OpenPGP Signature =
== Qubes ==
[[File:qubes-logo-blue.png|15px|link=Qubes]] [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]] templates are automatically verified when <code>qubes-dom0-update</code> downloads and installs them; manual user verification is unnecessary.

== VirtualBox ==
[[File:Virtualbox_logo.png|15px|link=VirtualBox]] Steps to verify the virtual machine images depend on the operating system in use:

* [[File:Tux.png|15px|link=]] [[Verify the virtual machine images using Linux|Linux using gpg]]
* [[File:Windows_logo_-_2012.svg.png|15px|link=]] [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Windows|Windows using Gpg4win]]
* [[File:rsz_osx.png|15px]] [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_macOS|macOS using GPGTools]]

Also see: [[VirtualBox/Appliance is not signed|VirtualBox <code>Appliance is not signed</code> Error Message]].

== KVM ==
[[File:Kvmbanner-logo26.png|30px|link=KVM]] Refer to the KVM [[File:Tux.png|15px|link=]] [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux|Linux]] instructions.

= Signify Signatures =
Moved to [[Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Linux#Signify]].

= Codecrypt Signatures =
[[PQCrypto#Codecrypt|Codecrypt]] signatures are not yet available, but are planned long term.

Volunteer contributions are happily considered! If you were to contribute <code>codecrypt</code> signature creation to the {{project_name_long}} [https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-prepare-release <code>dm-prepare-release</code> script], then this feature could be provided much sooner.

If you would like to use codecrypt for software signature verification, please consider making a report in the [https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-codecrypt-to-sign-whonix-releases/7844 codecrypt forum thread]. This method might be supported sooner if there is sufficient interest.
