= privleap versus polkit =
If there was a polkit implementation in Python that could make Privleap obsolete? No, probably not.

Polkit exists only to give "yes", "no", or "ask for authentication first" answers to "can user X do Y?" questions. It is unable to actually take the requested actions itself; it assumes the caller does that.

Privleap, on the other hand, is designed to actually perform actions on behalf of the calling user.

So no, they serve two related but distinct purposes.
