= User Documentation =
Reasons for using <code>mv</code> instead of <code>cp</code>:

* higher transparency
* file <code>/usr/share/keysrings/derivative.asc</code> is owned by the <code>repository-dist</code> package and overwritten by this file
** easier to debug: Should there be an issue with <code>/usr/share/keysrings/derivative.asc</code> (such as key expired) then it would be easier for the user to check which version of the key has been originally imported
