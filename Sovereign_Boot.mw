{{intro|
Sovereign Boot helps you control what your computer trusts during startup. Instead of relying on preinstalled vendor or third-party keys, it uses a guided wizard to let you enroll the keys you want, so only approved boot software can run.

= Introduction =
Sovereign Boot is a concept and toolset for making early boot security easier to understand and control. It focuses on the part of startup that happens before your operating system loads, where a small amount of trusted software decides what is allowed to run next.

Most normal computers ship with UEFI Secure Boot enabled or available, using preinstalled vendor and third party verification keys. In practice, this can mean your system trusts software signed by parties you did not choose, and the owner may be expected to rely on the platform vendor's decisions about what is allowed to run. This is closely related to [[Deep_scan_ready#Deep_Scan_Restricted|Deep Scan Restricted]] systems, where independent inspection and owner-controlled changes can be blocked by design.

Sovereign Boot aims to change that by using a provisioning wizard that guides you through creating a more user-controlled trust setup, based on what boot software you actually plan to use. This aligns with [[Deep_scan_ready|Deep Scan Ready]], where the owner can independently verify the full boot chain instead of trusting the running system blindly, and where owner-approved boot software is permissible rather than restricted.

For background on why this matters for malware investigation and offline inspection, see [[Deep_scan_ready#Technical_Implementation|Deep Scan Ready - Technical Implementation]] and [[Deep_scan_ready#Threat_Model_Differences|Deep Scan Ready - Threat Model Differences]].
