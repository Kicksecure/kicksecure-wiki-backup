{{intro|
This page contains a detailed overview and comparison of {{project_name_short}} and Debian regarding security hardening, privacy defaults and usability.
}}

= Introduction =

This wiki page compares the security‑focused, hardened defaults of {{project_name_short}} against upstream [https://www.debian.org Debian]. The differences are comprehensively detailed in several tables and visual highlighted below. The considered aspects are security hardening, a couple of privacy aspects and usability aspects.

This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about a system's CPU activity is leaked. It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of location-hidden services.</blockquote>

! Protection from supply chain attacks
| Mandates digital signature verification at all stages of development. This includes source code commits, git tags, the build process, and final downloads. Execution or deployment of unsigned code is strictly forbidden. The policy helps prevent supply chain attacks by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of software throughout its development and distribution.

## Emergency shutdown

- Forcibly powers off the system if the drive the system booted from is
  removed from the system.
- Forcibly powers off the system if a user-configurable "panic key sequence"
  is pressed (Ctrl+Alt+Delete by default).
- Forcibly powers off the system if
  `sudo /run/emerg-shutdown --instant-shutdown` is called.
- Optional - Forcibly powers off the system if shutdown gets stuck for longer
  than a user-configurable number of seconds (30 by default). Requires tuning
  by the user to function properly, see notes in
  `/etc/security-misc/emerg-shutdown/30_security_misc.conf`.
