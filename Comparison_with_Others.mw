| [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/tirdad TCP ISN randomization (tirdad)]
| TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization: mitigates TCP ISN-based CPU information leakage; see footnote. <ref>
<blockquote>The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug. It is leaked in any outgoing traffic. This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about a system's CPU activity is leaked. It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of location-hidden services.</blockquote>
