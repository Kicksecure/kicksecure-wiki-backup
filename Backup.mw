= How to Backup =
Copy all files to separate devices.

TODO: expand

= Why backups =
Storage devices are unreliable.

= Backup Redundancy =
It is often recommended:

* 1) local storage
* 2) backup on another drive
* 3) off-site backup: Either in a different physical location. This is to protect from theft, fire or similar. However, comes with different risks. Therefore [[Full Disk Encryption]] is recommended.

The more important the data is, the more redundancy is recommended.

= Cloud Based Backups =
Cloud backups are also an option but even if encrypted, it can be safely assumed many adversaries will keep a copy of the encrypted data hoping to one day be able to break the encryption. Cascading encryption is recommended when doing cloud based backups.
