See also chapter [[Operating_System_Hardening#Debian_Security_Announcements|Debian Security Announcements]].

== Operating System Updates ==
As strongly recommended in the Security Guide, it is necessary to regularly check for [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates|operating system updates]] on the host operating system, and both the {{project_name_workstation_long}} and {{project_name_gateway_long}}.

== Social Media Profiles ==

As some users will disregard this advice, messages from the {{project_name_long}} Feature Blog are most times posted on [https://t.me/{{project_telegram_all_news_channel_name}} {{project_name_long}} Telegram News Channel], [https://twitter.com/{{project_name_short}} {{project_name_long}} Twitter Profile] and the [https://www.facebook.com/{{project_name_short}} {{project_name_long}} Facebook Profile].

== Tor Bootstrap ==
Tor bootstrap refers to the process of attempting to connect to the Tor network (successfully or unsuccessfully). Familiar output related to this process includes: "Tor connecting xx percent...", "Tor not connected", "Tor connected" and so on. Bootstrapping does not refer to related concepts, such as whether connections are "secure", "not secure", "anonymous" or "not anonymous".

== Tor Browser ==
Tor Browser's built-in update check mechanism also works in {{project_name_long}}, so use it whenever updates become available. <ref>
The only exception is Tor Browser running in a DisposableVM in [[Qubes|{{qubes_project_name}}]], since the update will not persist.

For additional information about Tor Browser updates see [[Tor_Browser#Update_Tor_Browser|Tor Browser]]. Additionally, consider subscribing to https://blog.torproject.org for developments from The Tor Project.
