== Upgrade mw-multi-wiki - delete deleted files ==

'''DEV'''

* I suggest upgrading mw-multi-wiki
* Currently it is the case that files which are deleted are not updated during mw-multi-wiki deploy
* This means that a dev would have to delete the other files manually and keep track somewhere which files to delete later
* This is a problem because sometimes files should not be deleted before everything is finished and admin has approved development. And it also cannot be deleted before because then the wiki which is not updated yet would not function anymore
* So I suggest admin upgrades the mw-multi-wiki script and checks for formerly Category:MultiWiki files that are now deleted and delete them too
* Or maybe find another solution

Patrick:

* How mw-multi-wiki could detect deleted files from Category:MwDeleteMe?
** Currently mw-multi-wiki uses MediaWiki API to look at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Category:MultiWiki
** Once a page is deleted, it vanishes from the Category:MultiWiki page. Therefore mw-multi-wiki "forgets" about its existence.
* '''A)''' mw-multi-wiki could be stateful and "remember" which pages were ever in mw-multi-wiki but that's ugly because then an idempotent, clean script would be dependent on remembering the state in some state file. The state would be difficult to share among developers.
* '''B)''' A Category:MwDeleteMe could be invented. Delete all contents from the page and add that Category. Then mw-multi-wiki could remove it first from slave and eventually form the master wiki. Also non-ideal because not an intuitive process as it requires the developer to remember this because it's not a simple as using as using the wiki's internal deletion feature.
* '''C)''' Deletion log https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:Log/delete doesn't contain categories.
** Parsing the deleted revision for Category:MultiWiki might be error prone (if a wiki page was MultiWiki in the past but then it was only a comment).

status:

Patrick asked on the MediaWiki mailing list. https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/mediawiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/DIREH7YFVQPYHIJFFUXNBE6PVJ6OSMUX/

new idea: diff the categories in the different wikis

report only

== Logos Misc TODO ==
TODO:

* Content in Kicksecure wiki and Whonix wiki
* wiki text inconsistencies
** Chapter "Definitions" currently shows:
*** Logo - seems to unspecific
*** Landscape logo
*** Text logo
*** Icon logo
** Chapter "Current Kicksecure logos" uses a different language.
** Chapter "Current Whonix logos" uses a different language.
* logo consistent naming
* projectname-logo-definition
** <code>example</code>: kicksecure-logo-rectangular
** rename File, [[Special:ReplaceText]] to update old references

== MultiWiki: Think about PHP files ==

* For the workflow it would be good to not only deploy the js and css files to the "slave" wikis, but also the php-scripts for combined and headscript content
* Pro: if there are more than 2 wikis (which are not at the moment) then it's way easier to manage
* Con: At the moment it's not necessary. And we would need to be very careful with who gets the rights

== Stage Server as Master ==

* MultiWiki feature requests:
** The idea is the separate MultiWiki files into "code" (js, css files) and "content" (content pages)
** pull code (CSS, JS, widgets) from Kicksecure stage server
*** How about templates such as [[Template:Header]]?
**** These need to be in a special category to be recognized as code?
* stage server feature request:
** The stage server becomes the master server for code files. That way new scripts can be developed and tested on the stage server without disrupting the normal production use of the public wikis. Once a new feature is ready it can be multiwiki deployed from the stage server (master) to the slave wikis
* For content pages the Kicksecure wiki might still be the master however

== Newsletter Widget ==
* Widget here means "widget" generally as in a box with a special feature.
** Not necessarily a MediaWiki widget.
** Is there a better terminology than widget to avoid confusion?
* features:
** subscribe
** unsubscribe
** add the newsletter subscribe/unsubscribe to homepage
** the widget should be re-usable in other places in the wiki
** Ideally noJS compatible.
** Just two (subscribe/unsubscribe) POST submit boxes.
** The backend on the server could be a simple PHP script that just appends the e-mail address to a file subscribe.txt / unsubscribe.txt.
*** The PHP script should reject invalid e-mail address formats (such as with spaces in the middle or missing @ sign)
*** The PHP script would return "Success. Thanks for signing up!" or "Failure to sign-up. Please report this bug in the forums."
* non-features:
** double opt-in (this will be done manually at a later stage before sending any e-mails)
* TODO: discuss

'''DEV'''
* Topic was discussed. Script should be simple and at best not using a database
* Dev did newsletter research. Conclusions
** Most scripts are paid and proprietary, e. g. https://www.formget.com/newsletter-php-script/
** Most scripts are rather complex
** Most scripts use MySQL
* Options
** We could write a completely new scripts
** We could base a widget on the research by admin: https://github.com/rodhilton/maillister (an old script)
** We could by a modern script and set it up with mysql
* Admin said he will do script research again

== check image quality ==
todo: please download these images and compare with the original. Is there any visual degradation in image quality?

note: Not easy to download using a web browser. (reason: [[Dev/mediawiki#Debug_Images_Cache|Documentation for Kicksecure ™ Wiki Devs chapter Debug Images Cache]]) Download using a wget is simpler.

== Template:Wiki-work-in-progress add search engine exclusion and .noexcerpt ==
TODO:

* add search engine exclusion ([[Dev/mediawiki#Exclusion_of_text_parts_from_search_engine_indexing|Documentation for Kicksecure ™ Wiki Devs chapter Exclusion of text parts from search engine indexing]])
* add <code>.noexcerpt</code> HTML class

== MediaWiki Extension PageExtracts Fix ==
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TextExtracts

Update: enabled already.

* broken: https://www.kicksecure.com/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&exchars=175&titles=About
* compare with:
** https://www.kicksecure.com/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&exchars=175&titles=Testpage1
** https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&exchars=100&explaintext&titles=Earth

Potential solution: 

* Can we wrap all our custom HTML into a class <code>.noexcerpt</code>?
** As per: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TextExtracts#How_can_I_remove_content_from_a_page_preview/extract?
** What about our custom JavaScript?
** What about any inline CSS?

Why?

* Fixing this is required for https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Popups which otherwise always show a failed preview.

test page previews popups:

* [[Testpage1]] - works
* [[Testpage]] - works
* [[About]] - broken
* [[Homepage]] - broken
* [[FAQ]] - broken
* [[Documentation]] - broken
** [[Template:Expand_or_Collapse_All]] <code>.noexcerpt</code> needs wrapping?
* [[Download]] - broken (useless preview of wiki work in progress notice)
* [[KVM]] - broken
* [[VirtualBox]] - broken
* [[VirtualBox/XFCE]] - broken
* [[VirtualBox/CLI]] - broken
* [[First_Time_User]] - functional preview image but useless preview of wiki work in progress notice
* [[Dev/mediawiki]] - broken
** [[Template:intro]] <code>.noexcerpt</code> needs wrapping? But please only the HTML part markup language. Not the actual content. If that is even possible. Perhaps requires refactoring how the template is used?
* [[Dev/discourse]] - works
* check wiki internal links on [[Documentation]] - todo

== Font-Awesome fonts-preloading ==

== Our Donors wiki page ==
TODO research:

* How do other projects do this? Find some nice other examples how other projects express gratitude to their donnors 

TODO discuss:

* A wiki chapter on [[Contributors]] / https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Contributors or a dedicated wiki page?

TODO:

* named section: list with name and year of donation
* unnamed section: A message with a thank you to donors that prefer to stay not to be listed.
* "integrate" with [[Donate]]
** mention that donors are eligible to be added to the list of donors
* "integrate" with [[Contributors]]
** mention a thank you donors message and link to the donors wiki page
* [[Template:Contribute_mininav]]
** TODO discuss: useful? Would be a distraction on wiki/Donate?

'''DEV'''

* Donor page with nice intro and motivation for future donations
* A new template:
** {{CodeSelect|code=
{{donor
{{!}}name=John Doe
{{!}}range=rangeCode
{{!}}date=2023-03-03_for-sorting
}}
}}
** multi-line (easier to read and edit) (not single line)
** will be introduced and styled, maybe similar to open collective cards (see at the bottom here https://www.qubes-os.org/partners/ ) or be inspired by https://tails.boum.org/sponsors/index.en.html and https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors/
** Donor card gets a logo or photo or template
** Higher range means more greater looking card

== new thank you donation message ==
1) CORS issues are fixed now? (Patrick attempted to fix these.)

2) explain Patrick how to draft a HTML e-mail with text-only fallback in Thunderbird

3) e-mail for

* Kicksecure
* Whonix

== Whonix Linux Installer Wiki Page Improvements ==
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Linux

* edit button
** Why https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE has no edit button for steps 1, 2, 3, 4? (Which is good.)
** Why does https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Linux have edit buttons? Was resolved. Usage of [[Template:Box]] disables it. Might be a mediawiki bug. Not important.
* make underlying tab controller boxes more gray (internally uses mininav)
* Replace Xfce logo. Use an illustrative symbol illustrating a GUI.
* Remove extraneous newlines.
* Add spacer after bullet points?
* Thumbnail size?
* Content suggestions?
* Style / CSS suggestions?

== packages.debian.org APT package repository web interface ==
Debian (and most other Linux distributions) have something similar to <code>packages.debian.org</code>. Kicksecure and Whonix doesn't have that yet.

For example package [https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/nano nano]. These pages are highly useful as these show the name of the package, its version number, a short description, a long description, its dependencies, recommended and suggested packages among other useful related information and links.

Kicksecure has ~ 50 packages and Whonix has ~ 20 packages. Their names, functionality, version numbers etc. aren't well known since there's no similar web overview for these. The goal of this ticket is to implement something similar for Kicksecure (and separately for Whonix).

Preliminary research was done here: https://forums.whonix.org/t/packages-debian-org-apt-package-repository-web-interface-for-deb-whonix-org/10937

'''1.''' TODO research: the options mentioned in above linked forum thread? Which ones:

* look good enough,
* feasible to install / easy to setup,
* have a relativity small code base,
* no-JS compatible (information about packages should be indexed by google),
* low on zero reliance on (mysql) databases.

There's probably no perfect solution. Let's find the most suitable.

Perhaps a rough, quick, preliminary source code review of various options. Then discuss findings with admins.

* '''2.''' TODO discuss: Part two will probably be a more in-depth source code review. To be discussed later.

== video production - Hidden Text Attacks ==
Produce a video with the topic related to computer security only (not about anonymity). This is to justify Pretty Good Security channel being in the page footer of Kicksecure. (Because for now there are no security-only related topics.)

documentation here as base to develop a video script: https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Shell

1. create a script and add to [[Dev/videos]] (similar to https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/videos)

== Pagespeed Optimizations #2 ==
https://pagespeed.web.dev/ shows some suggestions:

* Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
** Heading elements in order is a very impractical metric which probably very few websites adhere to. Headline levels are very rarely used structurally (exception example MediaWiki and similar), but often rather as style choices. Especially smaller headlines which are very rarely used anyways h4-h6 are often used exclusively as style elements. For our project that would be possible especially if it's limited to few sites. But it would mean changing HTML as well as CSS
** TODO: discuss
* Form elements do not have associated labels
** Patrick fixed a similar warning here: https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Widget%3ADonation_Panel&type=revision&diff=66939&oldid=58997
** Form elements: This makes sense, but is there a ways to find out on which pages this should be applied? - are should I search all pages for form elements?
*** TODO: discuss: Only fix for our custom HTML/CSS. We didn't invent many forms anyhow? homepage, about, donate

== homepage html optimizations ==
For Kicksecure and Whonix homepage. To reduce DOM size.

Something doable, useful here?

Instead of using this code;

<pre>
<div id = ”navigation-main”>

    <ul>

            etc ..

    </ul>

</div>
</pre>

It would be better to use this other one;

<pre>
<ul id = ”navigation-main”>

    etc ..

</ul>
</pre>

== Defer Upstream MediaWiki JavaScript ==
now:

<pre>
<script async="" src="/w/load.php?lang=en&amp;modules=startup&amp;only=scripts&amp;raw=1&amp;skin=vector"></script>
</pre>

Patrick could server side easily rewrite that to:

<pre>
<script defer src="/w/load.php?lang=en&amp;modules=startup&amp;only=scripts&amp;raw=1&amp;skin=vector"></script>
</pre>

(Nobody uses <code>script async=""</code> (not a syntax error - asked upstream). This is easily string replaced to <code>script async</code> using nginx.)

== Wiki Content ==
=== Whonix-Host ===

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host

TODO:

* improve introduction, consider using font awesome using widget:Icon_Bullet_List if sensible
* How understandable is https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host#Terminology ? Please suggest improvements.
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host improvements:
** search ranking is too high for the "whonix live" search term
** will needs lot of more time until it materializes
** therefore meanwhile that page needs to be properly contextualized (Whonix-Host in development, volunteer help welcome, Whonix live available already anyhow)
* goal of page: illustrate goal, ask for contributions (very much worthwhile. The current progress as of now is for large part based on contributions.)
* About search ranking part: call with admin needed

=== Features ===
todo

* general review
* content improvement

soft todo:

* note: Whonix wiki/Features nicely shows a table when googleing for "Whonix features"
** Therefore keep/improve "Whonix ™ Soft Features" table

'''DEV'''

* irritating: The features listed here have other names and other profiles than the features listed on Homepage -> Somehow rename the page or chapter to make that better or other suggestions=
* Anonymous Browsing and Anonymous Communications, Hosting and Publishing seem to be more like use cases than features -> OK.
* Platform Flexibility
** What does "based on" have to do with flexibility? -> See chapter [[About#Based_on_Debian]]. In short: anything possible with the things its based on should work with Whonix too. No artificial restrictions or limitations which are often falsely assumed.
** What does "Free, Open Source, Libre, Freedom Software." have to do with flexibility? -> Customization is possible and relatively simple.
** What is "Virtual machine images with Type I or 2 hypervisors." ? -> https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/tip/Whats-the-difference-between-Type-1-vs-Type-2-hypervisor Why is that mentioned? Shows that Whonix is flexible enough to be ported to different hypervisors.
* Pre-installed software - why are there not all apps mentioned like on the homepage? -> Please update any missing ones. On wiki/Features it can be more use case based and more elaborated.
* What is "torification" for the uninformed user? -> Torification means the process of routing traffic over Tor.
* Security and Anonymity Protection: They are not real sentences. And it's highly technical. The reader does not know what is even meant by most of this -> True. Can be elaborated?
* Tor Network / Torification
** The text consists of sentences but is a pretty cold start. "Most applications can be" - where in Whonix or elsewhere? What is Tor? -> ""Most applications can be" - applies anywhere. Outside and inside of Whonix. But in that chapter, it's probably best to talk about Whonix. If mentioning the outside Whonix use case, then that there is a much higher risk for leaks. Related to https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Security_by_Isolation
** "Both, pre-installed and custom installed applications can be use" - does this have anything to do with tor? -> Related to flexibility of Whonix. Some people assume only pre-installed applications can be used. This is false. Also most custom installed applications can be installed. That should me mentioned somehow.
** This whole chapter seems like a technical documentation, not like a promotion. -> Good if it's both?
* Tunnel and Chaining Support: Very little explanation. Unintelligeble for non-technical users -> True. Please add more context.
* Tunnel Other Anonymizing Networks: like Tunnel and Chaining Support
* Tunnel Support: Very technical sentence and even more technical table
* Whonix ™ Soft Features: Explanations are mid-technical and rather "lifeless" -> True.

=== Mobile_Phone_Security wiki page content enhancements ===
TODO:

* read https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Phone_Security
* keep notes about the most shocking security and privacy issues, these will be needed for the summary chapter that is to be invented
* summary: on the very top, add a new chapter "Summary", write a summary on top why securing a smartphone and not being spied on is doable in theory but in practice pretty much unfeasible for most users.
* add a few more bulletpoints on the very top (currently there is only "Massive Data Harvesting by Most Phones." and "There are backdoors in most mobile devices."
* add introduction chapter on the very top?
* advice on a better page title as well as
** SEO description
** find/create better illustrative image
* other content suggestions?

== Whonix Homepage Image Fixes ==
* any illustrative images looking non-ideal and should be replaced?

== Kicksecure illustrative images ==
* any illustrative images looking non-ideal and should be replaced?

== illustrative images creation ==
Implementation probably needs discussion.

* Hiding your identity is harder than just hiding your IP.
* You can't be anonymous without being secure.
* your Whonix with Tor versus your IP without Whonix
* route randomization
* Ask yourself - privacy by design / privacy by policy
* freedom / freedom security / security
* why security matters
* why anonymity matters
