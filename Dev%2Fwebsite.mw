= TODO: ADMIN - DELAYED =

== Check Useragreement ==

Please check Useragreement on Kicksecure and Whonix. Widgets have been restored. But the "Yes" Widget seemed to be broken a while ago

== new thank you donation message ==
1) CORS issues are fixed now? (Patrick attempted to fix these.)

2) explain Patrick how to draft a HTML e-mail with text-only fallback in Thunderbird

3) Possible to have a plaintext fallback if HTML is disabled by the e-mail client?

4) e-mail for

* Kicksecure
* Whonix

5) bug?

This page is in Quirks Mode. Page layout may be impacted. For Standards Mode use “<!DOCTYPE html>”.

https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode

Valid HTML better / good idea for best e-mail reader compatibility?

'''DEV'''

# How can I check CORS issues?
# In thunderbird multipart email can be accomplished by going to "Options > Sending Format" and choose "Both HTML and Plain Text"
## This Sending Format however only seems to take effect if the mail is truly sent. So saving it as a draft and then "saving as" .eml does work but does not create a multipart email
## So maybe admin should send the email to his own email address and then save the .eml file
## However this eml file needs to be modified for each recipient, so there needs to be more work done
## Maybe another mail software needs to be involved
# The plaintext fallback is exactly what we want to accomplish with multipart
# What is meant with task 4?
# Maybe live discussion is needed

Patrick:

send HTML <code>Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=</code> message

== mediawiki-extensions-Purge ==
todo: discuss

What does https://github.com/AlPha5130/mediawiki-extensions-Purge/blob/master/resources/ext.purge.js (15 lines only) do?

Probably would have little effect for our wiki because of our custom skin? Does this functionality seem useful?

'''DEV'''
* The development of this extension seems pretty interesting
* The new extension (from pseudonym dev) is not much different from the original and seems to fix a faulty behavior of the original extension
* Both versions consist of 2 parts: ext.purge.js and Hooks.php
** In Hooks.php in every page (without our skin) there is a link added to call the purge page (which is not part of the extension but of mediawiki itself)
** This is just a convenience shortcut, but useful - even for us. Because if a dev is already on the edit page then our purge via super menu is not available. Removing this extension however would not be a terrible loss but a small convenience downgrade
** In ext.purge.js the convenience is even more improved for Javascript users only. Because then the link does not open the purge-page but is stopped and instead the purge action is instantly performed without going to the purge page
* Both versions are not perfect
** The original version fails to prevent the link to be augmented by Javascript. This might be due to it being loaded to early or other factors
** The newer version fixes this behavior but also prevents nojs users to use this button at all. It will be there but non-functional
* Suggestion (in order of preferability from Dev's perspective)
*# However because it would be mainly for our convenience I suggest use the newer version
*# If not then use the older version
*# If not then write our own fork which would be the perfect solution
*# Another option would be to just add our own purge button via a simple Javascript file on pages that don't have the skin. That would also be a ONLY-JS solution but it would be a bit quicker than the "perfect fork" solution
*# If not then don't use at all, because we have instant access to purge via our skin

Patrick:

* Do we even need the purge button still?
** Only for template changes?
** Otherwise cache invalidation is stable nowadays?
* Weird anyhow that non-admins can clear cache.
* MediaWiki's solution prevents crawlers from accidentally pressing that button.
* noJS support not required.
** JS-only solution good enough.
* Could we make it login-only or admin only?

== add querystring to Headscript ==
purpose: invalidate browser cache on css changes

* append querystring to our custom css/js
* append to fontawesome etc too?
* read version number from a local file in /srv/shared/cssversion/version-file
* sanity tests
** check it is a real number
** check string length maximum
* fall back to querystring=error if local file is missing or has invalid contents

how do we update the version number? options:

* hardcoded in headscript
* manually on file
* manually in MediaWiki:cssversion
* mw-combine can bump the version number but that might run too frequently (by the server, for testing, could be changed but non-ideal)
* by Patrick writing a script that checks if contents of mw-autogen folder changed (counting all file names and hashing all files)

Alternative considered <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header <code>stale-while-revalidate</code>:

* Would result in lots of <code>If-None-Match</code> requets and <code>304</code> responses.

== Upgrade mw-multi-wiki - delete deleted files ==

'''DEV'''

* I suggest upgrading mw-multi-wiki
* Currently it is the case that files which are deleted are not updated during mw-multi-wiki deploy
* This means that a dev would have to delete the other files manually and keep track somewhere which files to delete later
* This is a problem because sometimes files should not be deleted before everything is finished and admin has approved development. And it also cannot be deleted before because then the wiki which is not updated yet would not function anymore
* So I suggest admin upgrades the mw-multi-wiki script and checks for formerly Category:MultiWiki files that are now deleted and delete them too
* Or maybe find another solution

Patrick:

* How mw-multi-wiki could detect deleted files from Category:MwDeleteMe?
** Currently mw-multi-wiki uses MediaWiki API to look at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Category:MultiWiki
** Once a page is deleted, it vanishes from the Category:MultiWiki page. Therefore mw-multi-wiki "forgets" about its existence.
* '''A)''' mw-multi-wiki could be stateful and "remember" which pages were ever in mw-multi-wiki but that's ugly because then an idempotent, clean script would be dependent on remembering the state in some state file. The state would be difficult to share among developers.
* '''B)''' A Category:MwDeleteMe could be invented. Delete all contents from the page and add that Category. Then mw-multi-wiki could remove it first from slave and eventually form the master wiki. Also non-ideal because not an intuitive process as it requires the developer to remember this because it's not a simple as using as using the wiki's internal deletion feature.
* '''C)''' Deletion log https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:Log/delete doesn't contain categories.
** Parsing the deleted revision for Category:MultiWiki might be error prone (if a wiki page was MultiWiki in the past but then it was only a comment).

status:

Patrick asked on the MediaWiki mailing list. https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/mediawiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/DIREH7YFVQPYHIJFFUXNBE6PVJ6OSMUX/

new idea: diff the categories in the different wikis

report only

== Logos Misc TODO ==
TODO:

* github sponsors credit card
* Content in Kicksecure wiki and Whonix wiki
* wiki text inconsistencies
** Chapter "Definitions" currently shows:
*** Logo - seems to unspecific
*** Landscape logo
*** Text logo
*** Icon logo
** Chapter "Current Kicksecure logos" uses a different language.
** Chapter "Current Whonix logos" uses a different language.
* logo consistent naming
* projectname-logo-definition
** <code>example</code>: kicksecure-logo-rectangular
** rename File, [[Special:ReplaceText]] to update old references

== MultiWiki: Think about PHP files ==

* For the workflow it would be good to not only deploy the js and css files to the "slave" wikis, but also the php-scripts for combined and headscript content
* Pro: if there are more than 2 wikis (which are not at the moment) then it's way easier to manage
* Con: At the moment it's not necessary. And we would need to be very careful with who gets the rights

== Stage Server as Master ==

* MultiWiki feature requests:
** The idea is the separate MultiWiki files into "code" (js, css files) and "content" (content pages)
** pull code (CSS, JS, widgets) from Kicksecure stage server
*** How about templates such as [[Template:Header]]?
**** These need to be in a special category to be recognized as code?
* stage server feature request:
** The stage server becomes the master server for code files. That way new scripts can be developed and tested on the stage server without disrupting the normal production use of the public wikis. Once a new feature is ready it can be multiwiki deployed from the stage server (master) to the slave wikis
* For content pages the Kicksecure wiki might still be the master however

== Newsletter Widget ==
* Widget here means "widget" generally as in a box with a special feature.
** Not necessarily a MediaWiki widget.
** Is there a better terminology than widget to avoid confusion?
* features:
** subscribe
** unsubscribe
** add the newsletter subscribe/unsubscribe to homepage
** the widget should be re-usable in other places in the wiki
** Ideally noJS compatible.
** Just two (subscribe/unsubscribe) POST submit boxes.
** The backend on the server could be a simple PHP script that just appends the e-mail address to a file subscribe.txt / unsubscribe.txt.
*** The PHP script should reject invalid e-mail address formats (such as with spaces in the middle or missing @ sign)
*** The PHP script would return "Success. Thanks for signing up!" or "Failure to sign-up. Please report this bug in the forums."
* non-features:
** double opt-in (this will be done manually at a later stage before sending any e-mails)
* TODO: discuss

'''DEV'''
* Topic was discussed. Script should be simple and at best not using a database
* Dev did newsletter research. Conclusions
** Most scripts are paid and proprietary, e. g. https://www.formget.com/newsletter-php-script/
** Most scripts are rather complex
** Most scripts use MySQL
* Options
** We could write a completely new scripts
** We could base a widget on the research by admin: https://github.com/rodhilton/maillister (an old script)
** We could by a modern script and set it up with mysql
* Admin said he will do script research again
