* You can't be anonymous without being secure.
* your Whonix with Tor versus your IP without Whonix
* route randomization

* why security matters
* why anonymity matters

'''DEV'''
* It was agreed upon with admin that these tasks need a media / posting strategy first
* So this task is delayed until admin has such a strategy

== CSS hide some unused mediawiki footer items ==
pagespeed reporting:

Links are not crawlable

<pre>
footer#footer > ul#footer-places > li#footer-places-privacy > a
<a href="">
footer#footer > ul#footer-places > li#footer-places-about > a
<a href="">
footer#footer > ul#footer-places > li#footer-places-disclaimers > a
<a href="">
</pre>

The is the HTML which is most likely auto generated by mediawiki on every wiki pages's HTML:

<pre>
<footer id="footer" class="mw-footer" role="contentinfo" >
	<ul id="footer-info">
	<li id="footer-info-lastmod"> </li>
	<li id="footer-info-copyright">By using this website, you acknowledge you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these these agreements:</li>
</ul>

	<ul id="footer-places">
	<li id="footer-places-privacy"><a href=""></a></li>

</ul>
</pre>

To fix, please try adding to our CSS where appropriate:

{{CodeSelect|code=
#footer-places-privacy { display: none; }
#footer-places-about { display: none; }
#footer-places-disclaimers { display: none; }
}}

'''DEV'''
* Done
* Added to Mediawiki:Footer.css on Kicksecure and Whonix

Patrick:

Try the literal example CodeSelect box from above? Maybe works better than the combined CSS syntax?

'''DEV'''
* As discussed Admin will think of a solution, maybe write a bug report for Pagespeed

== Check Useragreement ==

Please check Useragreement on Kicksecure and Whonix. Widgets have been restored. But the "Yes" Widget seemed to be broken a while ago

== new thank you donation message ==
1) CORS issues are fixed now? (Patrick attempted to fix these.)

2) explain Patrick how to draft a HTML e-mail with text-only fallback in Thunderbird

3) Possible to have a plaintext fallback if HTML is disabled by the e-mail client?

4) e-mail for

* Kicksecure
* Whonix

5) bug?

This page is in Quirks Mode. Page layout may be impacted. For Standards Mode use “<!DOCTYPE html>”.

https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode

Valid HTML better / good idea for best e-mail reader compatibility?

'''DEV'''

# How can I check CORS issues?
# In thunderbird multipart email can be accomplished by going to "Options > Sending Format" and choose "Both HTML and Plain Text"
## This Sending Format however only seems to take effect if the mail is truly sent. So saving it as a draft and then "saving as" .eml does work but does not create a multipart email
## So maybe admin should send the email to his own email address and then save the .eml file
## However this eml file needs to be modified for each recipient, so there needs to be more work done
## Maybe another mail software needs to be involved
# The plaintext fallback is exactly what we want to accomplish with multipart
# What is meant with task 4?
# Maybe live discussion is needed

Patrick:

send HTML <code>Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=</code> message

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat filename.txt {{!}} sendmail -i test@test.com
}}

== mediawiki-extensions-Purge ==
todo: discuss

What does https://github.com/AlPha5130/mediawiki-extensions-Purge/blob/master/resources/ext.purge.js (15 lines only) do?

Probably would have little effect for our wiki because of our custom skin? Does this functionality seem useful?

'''DEV'''
* The development of this extension seems pretty interesting
* The new extension (from pseudonym dev) is not much different from the original and seems to fix a faulty behavior of the original extension
* Both versions consist of 2 parts: ext.purge.js and Hooks.php
** In Hooks.php in every page (without our skin) there is a link added to call the purge page (which is not part of the extension but of mediawiki itself)
** This is just a convenience shortcut, but useful - even for us. Because if a dev is already on the edit page then our purge via super menu is not available. Removing this extension however would not be a terrible loss but a small convenience downgrade
** In ext.purge.js the convenience is even more improved for Javascript users only. Because then the link does not open the purge-page but is stopped and instead the purge action is instantly performed without going to the purge page
* Both versions are not perfect
** The original version fails to prevent the link to be augmented by Javascript. This might be due to it being loaded to early or other factors
** The newer version fixes this behavior but also prevents nojs users to use this button at all. It will be there but non-functional
* Suggestion (in order of preferability from Dev's perspective)
*# However because it would be mainly for our convenience I suggest use the newer version
*# If not then use the older version
*# If not then write our own fork which would be the perfect solution
*# Another option would be to just add our own purge button via a simple Javascript file on pages that don't have the skin. That would also be a ONLY-JS solution but it would be a bit quicker than the "perfect fork" solution
*# If not then don't use at all, because we have instant access to purge via our skin

Patrick:

* Do we even need the purge button still?
** Only for template changes?
** Otherwise cache invalidation is stable nowadays?
* Weird anyhow that non-admins can clear cache.
* MediaWiki's solution prevents crawlers from accidentally pressing that button.
* noJS support not required.
** JS-only solution good enough.
* Could we make it login-only or admin only?

== Upgrade mw-multi-wiki - delete deleted files ==

'''DEV'''

* I suggest upgrading mw-multi-wiki
* Currently it is the case that files which are deleted are not updated during mw-multi-wiki deploy
* This means that a dev would have to delete the other files manually and keep track somewhere which files to delete later
* This is a problem because sometimes files should not be deleted before everything is finished and admin has approved development. And it also cannot be deleted before because then the wiki which is not updated yet would not function anymore
* So I suggest admin upgrades the mw-multi-wiki script and checks for formerly Category:MultiWiki files that are now deleted and delete them too
* Or maybe find another solution

Patrick:

* How mw-multi-wiki could detect deleted files from Category:MwDeleteMe?
** Currently mw-multi-wiki uses MediaWiki API to look at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Category:MultiWiki
** Once a page is deleted, it vanishes from the Category:MultiWiki page. Therefore mw-multi-wiki "forgets" about its existence.
* '''A)''' mw-multi-wiki could be stateful and "remember" which pages were ever in mw-multi-wiki but that's ugly because then an idempotent, clean script would be dependent on remembering the state in some state file. The state would be difficult to share among developers.
* '''B)''' A Category:MwDeleteMe could be invented. Delete all contents from the page and add that Category. Then mw-multi-wiki could remove it first from slave and eventually form the master wiki. Also non-ideal because not an intuitive process as it requires the developer to remember this because it's not a simple as using as using the wiki's internal deletion feature.
* '''C)''' Deletion log https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:Log/delete doesn't contain categories.
** Parsing the deleted revision for Category:MultiWiki might be error prone (if a wiki page was MultiWiki in the past but then it was only a comment).

status:

Patrick asked on the MediaWiki mailing list. https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/mediawiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org/thread/DIREH7YFVQPYHIJFFUXNBE6PVJ6OSMUX/

== MultiWiki: Think about PHP files ==

* For the workflow it would be good to not only deploy the js and css files to the "slave" wikis, but also the php-scripts for combined and headscript content
* Pro: if there are more than 2 wikis (which are not at the moment) then it's way easier to manage
* Con: At the moment it's not necessary. And we would need to be very careful with who gets the rights

== Stage Server as Master ==

* MultiWiki feature requests:
** The idea is the separate MultiWiki files into "code" (js, css files) and "content" (content pages)
** pull code (CSS, JS, widgets) from Kicksecure stage server
*** How about templates such as [[Template:Header]]?
**** These need to be in a special category to be recognized as code?
* stage server feature request:
** The stage server becomes the master server for code files. That way new scripts can be developed and tested on the stage server without disrupting the normal production use of the public wikis. Once a new feature is ready it can be multiwiki deployed from the stage server (master) to the slave wikis
* For content pages the Kicksecure wiki might still be the master however

== Newsletter Widget ==
* Widget here means "widget" generally as in a box with a special feature.
** Not necessarily a MediaWiki widget.
** Is there a better terminology than widget to avoid confusion?
* features:
** subscribe
** unsubscribe
** add the newsletter subscribe/unsubscribe to homepage
** the widget should be re-usable in other places in the wiki
** Ideally noJS compatible.
** Just two (subscribe/unsubscribe) POST submit boxes.
** The backend on the server could be a simple PHP script that just appends the e-mail address to a file subscribe.txt / unsubscribe.txt.
*** The PHP script should reject invalid e-mail address formats (such as with spaces in the middle or missing @ sign)
*** The PHP script would return "Success. Thanks for signing up!" or "Failure to sign-up. Please report this bug in the forums."
* non-features:
** double opt-in (this will be done manually at a later stage before sending any e-mails)
* TODO: discuss

'''DEV'''
* Topic was discussed. Script should be simple and at best not using a database
* Dev did newsletter research. Conclusions
** Most scripts are paid and proprietary, e. g. https://www.formget.com/newsletter-php-script/
** Most scripts are rather complex
** Most scripts use MySQL
* Options
** We could write a completely new scripts
** We could base a widget on the research by admin: https://github.com/rodhilton/maillister (an old script)
** We could by a modern script and set it up with mysql
* Admin said he will do script research again

== FlaggedRevisions CacheClear Workaround ==
TODO

= TODO DEV =

== pagespeed - others ==
This is just a catchall for those that I might have forgotten above.

Please recheck pagespeed, please fix the "usual" things not covered yet.

* Kicksecure
* Whonix

pages:

* homepage
* about
* documentation
* VirtualBox

TODO: please fix those which are fixable with reasonable effort

* Dev: There are two problems reported about console errors and source attribution for Javascript files. Should this be addressed by Dev too?
** Patrick: Yes, please, if effort is reasonable.

'''DEV'''
* DONE
* Kicksecure and Whonix hp look very good. One issue "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED" can not be reproduced in local Lighthouse, only on Pagespeed (PS). This might be a timing issue or a CORS issue. But for testing admin would have to enable cross-origin-resource-policy: cross-site on the server. This might however be a (small) security risk and therefore not a long term solution. DEV thinks it might be a timing issue with PS loading the files too late and therefore being rejected by the server. Maybe a longer server timeout could solve this problem.
* Whonix and Kicksecure About pages are now solved apart from MediaWiki issues that are reported as bug reports
* Whonix and Kicksecure Documentation pages are now also fixed. There was a footer image ratio error fixed which also positively affects all other pages

3) What is causing these bugs? Reproducible on other websites?

4) Please check for existing bug reports / draft a bug report for Tor Browser.

5) updated (written for clarity): This Tor Browser bug is similar to images slow or never loading. This is not directly our bug. However, is there something that can be done better on our website to workaround this bug? In case if images fail to load (or maybe some browsers / crawlers not loading images) then it would be good if our website looks somewhat good anyhow as such things would likely be visible on a very slow load as it might happen over Tor / flaky networks. If possible with reasonable effort.

== Pagespeed Documentation pages : mw-collapsible label ==

'''DEV'''
* DONE
* There was a Lighthouse error "Heading elements are not in sequentially - descending order". This was due to headlines used as mw-collapsible labels
* This was solved by introducing p-element as label, see documentation [[Dev/mediawiki#Expand_.28mw-collapsible.29_paragraph_as_label|Expand (mw-collapsible) paragraph as label]]

== pagespeed About Whonix and Kicksecure - touch targets spacing ==

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About problem "Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing."

'''DEV'''
* Done depending on admin
* The number of problematic items was greatly reduced from about 30 to now 4
* All citation backlink arrows were corrected and also look better now (see Footnotes)
* Archiv links and external links have now more spacing to the archiv and onion symbols. Those symbols are also a bit lower now (to have more space above)
* 4 items are still critized. Dev could try to fix those too, but it seems to be a tougher task because they could also be "false positives"
* Question to admin: As the icons for archive and onion are now farther away from the link words I would suggest forcing the icons to NOT break on their own at a new line but only break together with the link text. What is your opinion?

'''DEV'''
* DONE
* All touch targets are now properly spaced. No problems left
* Archive links still looking good
* Citation backlinks look better now (more readable)
* Also new line nowrap idea was implemented in Template and Widget Archive Link. Also a new parameter was introduced "linewrap" for very long link to still allow line wrap if needed. See here for updated documentation [[Dev/mediawiki#Archive_link_.28Template.29|Archive_link (Template)]]

== pagespeed - others - Whonix About ==

* Dev: "Values assigned to role="" are not valid ARIA roles." - this evolves around TOC which is rendered with HTML non-conformities. However this seems to be caused by the old vector skin which is not developed any further, so a bug report would be futile. We could however remove this element via Javascript. This fixes the problem and would also be easy with minimal effort to implement in our TOCLevelSwitcher script.
** Vector Legacy: While "Legacy" is in its name, it doesn't mean that bug reporting are off limits or that pull requests would be rejected? It might mean that. Name "legacy" is motivation to check if that is the case. It however, cannot be taken granted just based on the name.
**  Please write a mediawiki upstream bug report (if it does not exist yet) for this issue so I can forward it to a mediawiki contributor who would send a pull request.
* Dev: "Form elements do not have associated labels" - this evolves around the same TOC elements from above. So a Mediawiki request or bug report might be out of the picture. Javascript solution is also possible here.
** Same as above.
* "Links do not have a discernible name" - this is the issue regarding a.mw-file-magnify what was bug-reported by us to MediaWiki recently. However here a Javascript solution is also possible. This solution could be removed once the fix it.
** Patrick: No JS based fixes please in this case. Upstream issues which upstream is likely to fix, we wait for upstream.
* Dev: "Links are not crawlable" - We wrote a bug report about this too, it's about a.mw-selflink.selflink. Our suggestion was to add a role. This can also be fixed temporarily with Javascript
** Patrick: No JS based fixes please in this case. Upstream issues which upstream is likely to fix, we wait for upstream.

'''DEV'''
* DONE
* No JS acknowledged
* Bug report below (with framing why it's still relevant). Side note for admin: It seems that the TOC rendering that WE have in the wiki is by the MediaWiki core, specifically Parsoid, and not the skin. It appears that the new vector skin functions differently and renders the TOC itself, therefore the new vector TOC has a lot of classes with "vector-" in it and the id "vector-toc". This is also implied here https://stackoverflow.com/a/76055033

'''Legacy Vector TOC Lighthouse bugs due to toggle collapse'''

We are using Legacy Vector and it's TOC with the up-to-date MediaWiki version. There are two Lighthouse bugs happening due to invalid HTML in the TOC toctogglecheckbox and toctogglelabel

First, "label.toctogglelabel" is empty which is not valid and which triggers "Form elements do not have associated labels" in Lighthouse for "input#toctogglecheckbox". A label-element needs to have text or another describing HTML element. We suggest adding the "collapse" text not via CSS, but regularely as text. Or add a span element with this text if more flexibility for CSS styling is needed

Second, "input#toctogglecheckbox" has the role "button" which is not valid for an input checkbox element and therefore triggers "Values assigned to role="" are not valid ARIA roles." in Lighthouse. We suggest simply removing role="button" which is the invalid part and not necessary.

== Top Headline missing edit button ==

* One page Dev/mediawiki a headline was shown as headline level 1 but had no edit button

'''DEV'''
* Semi fix. Please archive task
* Bug was thoroughly examined.
* No Javascript, CSS or HTML bug
* Previous and following chapter were analysed
* Also the previous, this and the following chapter were copied to a testpage were everything worked fine
* It seemed the previous chapter also loads the chapter with the missing editsection button. So it was assumed the problem lies in the previous chapter, so sections of the were strategically deleted to find the problematic subsection.
* The problem was a wikitable in the direct previous chapter, a level 2 headline. Removing the wikitable solved the problem. But this is not a solution, so wikitable was just html-commented out (and notice was given)
* Dev would normally suggest a bug report to MediaWiki. However the bug is not reproducable in a smaller test page, see [[Testpage]]. It seems this is a "complexity bug", which is cause by multiple not obviously connected causes. Dev also performed a full page wikitext analysis and found no syntax errors (just very few of spelling errors which were corrected)
* So Dev suggests just archiving these finds and for now work with html-commenting out the problematic tables if necessary. If the bug becomes a practical one (and not a theoretical one like now) this should be reinvestigated
