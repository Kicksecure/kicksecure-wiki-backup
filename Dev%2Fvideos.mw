== IDN Homograph Attacks ==
<blockquote>Beware of URL Impersonation: How Scammers Trick You with Lookalike Letters</blockquote>

Imagine you're visiting what you believe to be your bank's website. You verify the web address in the URL bar, and it appears to be exactly as expected. However, you're actually on a fake website created by scammers. This fake website looks identical to your bank's website, but it's designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information such as your password, credit card number, or other personal data.

This attack has been demonstrated by a security researcher using apple.com. The URL clearly shows "apple.com," but instead of the sleek, polished brand website, you'll be greeted by a friendly warning message from the researcher. Surprisingly, this attack cannot be spotted with the human eye by looking at the link. Luckily, it was just a friendly security researcher and not a scammer. The link to the researchers attack demonstration and further information can be found in the video description.

The researcher could have tricked users but he didn't. However, scammers won't be so friendly. Scammers can easily make their fake websites look and function exactly like the real ones, using a technique called proxying, which is not even very difficult for savvy developers.

Scammers often create URLs that resemble those of well-known brands to trick users into visiting their fake websites. They use "lookalike letters" or homoglyphs from different languages to replace English letters and create "lookalike words" called homographs. For example, they might use a Greek "a" instead of an English "a" to create a fake homograph that makes the browser render "apple.com". However, instead of the legitimate website, you'll be visiting a domain that the attacker controls. This is how they deceive users and trick them into revealing sensitive information such as their passwords and 2FA logins.

Fortunately, you can avoid falling victim to this attack. Internal to the browser, the punicode version of apple.com is converted by the browser into a strange letter salad (https://www.xn—80ak6aa92e.com), clearly not the real apple.com. However, most browsers unfortunately, do not display you the internal representation for your convenience and for better support of non-Latin languages at the expense of your security.

If you come across a suspicious URL in an email, chat, or website, don't click on it. Instead, type the URL into the address bar yourself or copy and paste it into the browser's address bar.

[ In the video, show the URL bar and demonstrate typing the URL by hand. ]

You can also change browser settings to disable punycode, but this works well only for Latin languages and not international audiences.

Alternatively, you could right-click the URL, copy the URL, and sanitize it. What you think you copied might not be what you really copied, so it's crucial to sanitize the URL. If you want to learn more about how to sanitize URLs and protect yourself from hidden text attacks, check out our previous video.

In summary, URL impersonation is a common tactic used by scammers to steal sensitive information from unsuspecting users. To protect yourself, remember to:

* Manually type URLs into the address bar: This is a safer way to access websites than clicking on suspicious links. This way, you can ensure that you are visiting the intended website and not a fake one created by scammers.
* Disable punycode in your browser settings: This will prevent homoglyphs from being used in URLs to deceive you. Note that this may not work well for non-Latin languages.
* Sanitize any suspicious URLs before clicking on them: Right-click the URL, copy it, and sanitize it to make sure it's safe to visit.

How to defend yourself from this attack is also documented in our wiki.

== Don’t ever blindly trust screenshots [YT short] ==

In the age of AI, you may have encountered amusing or deceptive deepfaked videos and fabricated sound bites, such as Joe Rogan discussing his love for Bionicle with Jordan Peterson, or US presidents insulting each other in video games. AI deepfakes have the potential to pose significant threats in the future.

Doctoring screenshots is even easier and requires significantly less effort than using Photoshop. Everyone can do it and it takes less than one minutes.

Few people understand how HTML actually works. Even fewer are aware that most desktop browsers come with integrated developer tools to modify HTML, rendering the page differently if you edit it. Here's a short demonstration. In the browser, press F12 or find the option in the menu, or simply highlight a phrase on a webpage, right-click, and choose "Inspect element".

When the developer tools open, double-click on the HTML element containing the text you want to change, and voilà, you can type whatever you desire. This method works on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and any other website.

This method can be easily abused by scammers. Stay vigilant and avoid jumping to conclusions based solely on unconfirmed screenshots that circulate on the internet. Use other sources and critical thinking. And only then make up your mind.

== Vid #001 : OOPS! They tricked me to install MALWARE! Clipboard Hidden Text Attacks explained ==


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<h4>Show Script</h4>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
We've all done it before, even if we're reluctant to admit it: we scour the internet for a quick code solution or terminal instruction, find a page, locate the code box, without even thinking we copy the code or even more conveniently click the copy button. Hastely we insert the text into our terminal and hit enter - only to realize ... there's something wrong. We just installed malware and corrupted your system.

[bumper]

Hopefully the last part didn't happen to you. But clipboard hidden text attacks are a common danger on the internet, although they're often overshadowed by phishing hidden text attacks. Nonetheless, they pose a real threat and should remind us not to get too comfortable copying text from unconfirmed sources on the internet, especially when it comes to our most sensitive systems.

[bumper]

First, let's have a look at phishing hidden text because that's what you will find first when you search the internet.

In recent years, phishing with hidden text and zero font attacks have become increasingly popular. Scammers use HTML emails and CSS to hide characters and bypass spam filters used by email providers. Typically, words that indicate major brand corporations would trigger heightened scrutiny of the email filter. However, by splitting up these words with hidden letters and characters, the spam filter can't recognize them. Unfortunately, the user can be tricked because they can't see this hidden obfuscation and only see the plain brand name meant to trick them.

[bumper]

Scammers also use a similar technique called clipboard hidden text attacks, often utilizing code boxes. They may have corrupted a website or created a mockup site to lure in unsuspecting victims who are eager to copy code from code boxes. The user sees the code they need in the code box, but once they click the copy button, a little bit more than just the code is copied to their clipboard – usually something malicious.

Here's how it works: the code box is filled with a cover text that the user can see. However, the area surrounding the cover text is also filled with malicious code that's hidden by CSS instructions on the webpage. When the JavaScript copy command is executed, the entire clipboard is copied as plain text, including the cover text and the malware.

Once you insert this text into your terminal and hit enter or, worse, have your terminal auto-execute it, you're in trouble.

[bumper]

The good news is that this attack isn't very common and can easily be avoided if you are willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of convenience.

We highly recommend making this sacrifice because, for scammers, this attack is also very low risk and very convenient. So although the success rate might be fairly low, the effort is so low that they might as well try if they have the opportunity.

[bumper]

Here are four ways you can protect yourself:

1. Be vigilant everytime you copy code from the internet, especially with regards to shell commands, and even more so if those commands grant super user rights.

2. Never have your terminal set to automatically execute pasted commands. Find this option in your operating system or terminal settings and turn it off.

3. Consider using a clipboard manager, which is available on all operating systems, to check the actual content of your clipboard conveniently.

4. For high security, follow these six steps: (1) Copy the text into a graphical text editor first. (2) Read and understand all the commands. (3) Save the file as a local text file. (4) Scan this file for any malicious Unicode characters. (5) Only then copy the text from this local file, as the text editor may have automatically omitted some Unicode characters that were initially in your clipboard. (6) Now you can safely paste the command into the terminal and execute it.

We hope this helped you avoid becoming a victim out of convenience. Be vigilant and be save.
