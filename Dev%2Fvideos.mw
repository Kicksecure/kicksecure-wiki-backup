== Hijacking your browser with fake URLs – URL impersonation homograph attacks explained [YT short] ==

When you visit apple.com, imagine being greeted by a friendly warning message from a researcher instead of the sleek, polished brand website. Surprisingly, the URL clearly shows "apple.com."

Scammers continuously devise new methods to deceive unsuspecting victims, and URL impersonation is one of them. Enabled by a browser feature necessary for international audiences, URL impersonation tricks users with URLs resembling well-known brands. These URLs use "lookalike letters" or homoglyphs from Greek, German, Spanish, and other languages to replace English letters. "Lookalike words" crafted with these letters are called homographs.

Scammers might use a Greek "a" instead of an English "a" to create the fake homograph apple.com, deceiving users into visiting the wrong website.

Fortunately, you can avoid falling victim to this attack. Browsers must convert all URLs to a limited character set called ASCII. To display international characters, browsers encode them into an ASCII subset called punycode. In reality, the fake URL apple.com is converted by the browser into a strange letter salad (https://www.xn—80ak6aa92e.com/), clearly not apple.com. But most browser tragically won’t show you this salad for your convenience.

To check the legitimacy of a suspicious-looking email URLs, avoid clicking the link. Instead, right-click, copy the address, and if you're using Whonix or Kicksecure, open a console and type idn2 [your url]. Alternatively, visit kicksecure.com/app/checkURL for your convenience.

Stay vigilant and be safe.

== Don’t ever blindly trust screenshots [YT short] ==

In the age of AI, you may have encountered amusing or deceptive deepfaked videos and fabricated sound bites, such as Joe Rogan discussing his love for Bionicle with Jordan Peterson, or US presidents insulting each other in video games. AI deepfakes have the potential to pose significant threats in the future.

However, doctoring screenshots is even easier and requires significantly less effort than using Photoshop.

Few people understand how HTML actually works. Even fewer are aware that most desktop browsers come with integrated developer tools to modify HTML. Press F12 or find the option in the menu, or simply highlight a phrase on a webpage, right-click, and choose "Inspect element."

When the developer tools open, double-click on the HTML element containing the text you want to change, and voilà, you can type whatever you desire. This trick works on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and any other website.

We do not encourage faking tweets, comments, or direct messages to incriminate others. Instead, we urge you to remain vigilant and avoid jumping to conclusions based solely on unconfirmed screenshots. Use other sources and critical thinking. And only then make up your mind.

== Vid #001 : OOPS! They tricked me to install MALWARE! Clipboard Hidden Text Attacks explained ==


<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<h4>Show Script</h4>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
We've all done it before, even if we're reluctant to admit it: we scour the internet for a quick code solution or terminal instruction, find a page, locate the code box, without even thinking we copy the code or even more conveniently click the copy button. Hastely we insert the text into our terminal and hit enter - only to realize ... there's something wrong. We just installed malware and corrupted your system.

[bumper]

Hopefully the last part didn't happen to you. But clipboard hidden text attacks are a common danger on the internet, although they're often overshadowed by phishing hidden text attacks. Nonetheless, they pose a real threat and should remind us not to get too comfortable copying text from unconfirmed sources on the internet, especially when it comes to our most sensitive systems.

[bumper]

First, let's have a look at phishing hidden text because that's what you will find first when you search the internet.

In recent years, phishing with hidden text and zero font attacks have become increasingly popular. Scammers use HTML emails and CSS to hide characters and bypass spam filters used by email providers. Typically, words that indicate major brand corporations would trigger heightened scrutiny of the email filter. However, by splitting up these words with hidden letters and characters, the spam filter can't recognize them. Unfortunately, the user can be tricked because they can't see this hidden obfuscation and only see the plain brand name meant to trick them.

[bumper]

Scammers also use a similar technique called clipboard hidden text attacks, often utilizing code boxes. They may have corrupted a website or created a mockup site to lure in unsuspecting victims who are eager to copy code from code boxes. The user sees the code they need in the code box, but once they click the copy button, a little bit more than just the code is copied to their clipboard – usually something malicious.

Here's how it works: the code box is filled with a cover text that the user can see. However, the area surrounding the cover text is also filled with malicious code that's hidden by CSS instructions on the webpage. When the JavaScript copy command is executed, the entire clipboard is copied as plain text, including the cover text and the malware.

Once you insert this text into your terminal and hit enter or, worse, have your terminal auto-execute it, you're in trouble.

[bumper]

The good news is that this attack isn't very common and can easily be avoided if you are willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of convenience.

We highly recommend making this sacrifice because, for scammers, this attack is also very low risk and very convenient. So although the success rate might be fairly low, the effort is so low that they might as well try if they have the opportunity.

[bumper]

Here are four ways you can protect yourself:

1. Be vigilant everytime you copy code from the internet, especially with regards to shell commands, and even more so if those commands grant super user rights.

2. Never have your terminal set to automatically execute pasted commands. Find this option in your operating system or terminal settings and turn it off.

3. Consider using a clipboard manager, which is available on all operating systems, to check the actual content of your clipboard conveniently.

4. For high security, follow these six steps: (1) Copy the text into a graphical text editor first. (2) Read and understand all the commands. (3) Save the file as a local text file. (4) Scan this file for any malicious Unicode characters. (5) Only then copy the text from this local file, as the text editor may have automatically omitted some Unicode characters that were initially in your clipboard. (6) Now you can safely paste the command into the terminal and execute it.

We hope this helped you avoid becoming a victim out of convenience. Be vigilant and be save.
