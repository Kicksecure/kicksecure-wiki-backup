= Open Drafts =
'''What does Open Drafts mean?''' - These are scripts for videos which have not been produced yet. Therefore any feedback (edit suggestions) are more likely to make it in the video which is due to be produced soon.

There may be some inaccuracies in the Open Drafts.

Open Drafts should not be considered [[Documentation]] or factual statements until finalized.

= Finalized Drafts =
'''What does Finalized Drafts mean?''' - These drafts are not very useful to modify because the video has already been produced, pending upload. Unless there are critical issues, no changes will be recorded.
