== Introduction ==

The success of the {{project_name_long}} platform is the sum total of several factors:

* The software provided by several other projects (like KVM,Qubes) and the tireless efforts of their many developers and contributors. <ref>Which form part of the core privacy and security features in {{project_name_long}}.</ref>
* Lessons learned from:
** Expert advice provided in various Internet forums and attendance at software development events.
** Previous failures and successes in the {{project_name_long}} development cycle.
** The failures and successes of similar privacy/security projects (like Tails).
* Inspiration drawn from other projects, leading to the implementation of new or improved security features.
* Direct contributions by the {{project_name_long}} community.
