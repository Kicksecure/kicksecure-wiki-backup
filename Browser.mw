= Introduction =
A browser is a program you use to access and view websites on the internet, like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. It lets you search for information, watch videos, check email, and more by showing web pages.

= {{project_name_short}} Default Browser =
* <u>At time of writing:</u> Firefox is installed by default inside {{project_name_short}}.
* <u>Future:</u> For a future version of {{project_name_short}}, it is planned to no longer install a browser by default inside {{project_name_short}}.

= No Default Browser =
No browser exists at time of writing that can be wholeheartedly recommended for users of {{project_name_short}} according to technical [[Dev/Default_Browser#Criteria|Criteria]] (security, privacy and user freedom).

These reasons are elaborated on the [[Dev/Default_Browser|Kicksecure Default Browser - Development Considerations]] wiki page and will soon be summarized here.

= Issues with Browsers =
Most mainstream browsers are considered spyware by many people. See also [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Selling_User_Data|Firefox Selling User Data]].

This issue cannot be solved by operating system vendors such as {{project_name_short}}. For reasons why that is, see [[Dev/Default_Browser#In-House_Browser_Development|In-House Browser Development]].

= Browser Comparison =
== Browser Comparison - Introduction ==
Here is a list of commonly discussed browser within the security and privacy communities with their main disadvantages.

The browsers are listed in rough order of their market share and popularity.

== Chrome ==
Discouraged.

{{Non-freedom-software}}

'''Advantages:'''

* Most popular and therefore presumably most compatible browser.

'''Disadvantages:'''

* closed source, non-freedom software

'''Why not default in Kicksecure:'''

* Not Open Source. See [[Browser#Open_Source_Browsers_Only|Open Source Browsers Only]].

== Chromium ==
'''Advantages:'''

* Might be similarly compatible as Chrome due to its shared code base.

'''Disadvantages:'''

* Similar to Chrome, see above.

'''Why not default in Kicksecure:'''

* No official binary builds.
* [[Dev/Chromium#Chromium_Debian_Package_Security|security issues with the Chromium package in Debian]]
* [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Beyond_Licensing|concerns about user autonomy related to browser market dominance]]

'''More technical details:''' [[Dev/Default_Browser#Chromium|Chromium]]

== Mullvad Browser ==
'''Advantages:'''

* <u>Anti-browser fingerprinting:</u> Makes it harder for websites to track you based on your browser’s settings. This helps protect your privacy.
* <u>Security features:</u> Has a "security level" setting that lets you choose stronger protection. Higher levels may break some websites but give better security.
* <u>Installation:</u> [https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux Debian package repository available.] This lets users on Debian-based systems, including {{project_name_short}}, easily install and update Mullvad Browser using tools like <code>apt</code>.

'''Disadvantages:'''

* Based on Firefox ESR, which might be less secure than Firefox Rapid Release, see [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Security_-_ESR_.28Extended_Support_Release.29_versus_Rapid_Release|Firefox Security - ESR (Extended Support Release) versus Rapid Release]].

'''Why not default in {{project_name_short}}:'''

* Not a vendor neutral 
** Includes Mullvad branding, uses Mullvad DNS by default, and promotes its VPN service, tying it to a specific commercial provider.
** Creates potential reputational risks for {{project_name_short}} by suggesting endorsement or sponsorship by a VPN company.
** Could lead to user suspicion of paid promotion, harming the project's perception of independence and trustworthiness.

== Mozilla Firefox ==
The issue of [[Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Selling_User_Data|Firefox Selling User Data]] was [https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/information-about-the-new-terms-of-use-and-updated-privacy/m-p/88189/highlight/true perceived very badly by the community.]

Therefore Firefox will be no longer installed by default inside {{project_name_short}} in a future version as soon as [[Dev/browser-choice]] has been implemented.

= What Users Can Do =
The situation is clearly unsatisfactory. Here is what users can do:

* Stay in the loop. Subscribe to relevant discussions.
* Conduct deep research.
* Stay vigilant.
* Demand transparency.
* Demand radio silence.
* Support [[Gemini|Geminispace‎]], SmolNet.
* Wait for privacy-respecting browsers to become available.

= Open Source Browsers Only =
Browsers that are closed source (not Open Source) are only briefly mentioned and discouraged. See also [[Reasons_for_Freedom_Software|Reasons for Freedom Software / Open Source]].

{{Avoid nonfreedom software}}

= Advanced Topics =
The following topics are for [[Advanced Users]] only.

== Browser DDOS Vulnerabilities ==
{{intro|
Can browser be frozen by heavy JavaScript as an attack? Other vulnerabilities? What happens if JavaScript is constantly fetched or if the browser's DOM is 1 GB++ large?
}}

{{AdvancedUsersOnly}}

* Vulnerabilities
*# '''Infinite Loops / Infinite Recursion''' : <code>while(true) {}</code> can cause the browser to freeze and <code>function recursive() { recursive(); }</code> can crash the browser due to stack overflow. There are safeguards in place in modern browsers but it's still a risk especially if combined with other attacks
*# '''Memory consumption''' : By creating an extremely large DOM or an extremely large array the memory can be consumed leading to slowdown of the OS or crash of the browser
*# '''Fetching humongous data''' : Constantly / infinitely fetching giant data files can slow down the browser or freeze it
*# '''Forced reflows and layouts''' : By constantly changing huge parts of the layout of the page in short intervals the browser can be slowed down
*# '''iframe overload''' : Creating a huge amount of iframes - even without source - and adding them to the page can slow down the browser
*# '''iframe inception''' : an iframe references the same page it is on, which in turn creates another iframe that references the same page, and so on. This can lead to an infinite loop, causing the browser to consume significant resources and potentially become unresponsive or crash.
* These are the most common and even some less likely DDOS vulnerabilites for the browser. Most modern browsers are safeguarded against this as much as possible. But as there is often no way to differentiate if a huge memory consumption is benevolent or malevolent the browser has to accept most of these commands
* In the past Javascript was more powerful in the browsers giving it some OS access. But due to virusses and malware all browsers now use a sandbox to severely limit Javascript capabilities
