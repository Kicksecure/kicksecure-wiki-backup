Security warning: Adding a third party repository allows the vendor to replace any package on your system. Proceed at your own risk! See [[Install_Software#Foreign_Sources|Foreign Sources]] for further information. For greater safety, users adding third party repositories should always use [[Multiple_{{project_name_workstation_short}}|Multiple {{project_name_workstation_long}}]] to compartmentalize VMs with additional software.
