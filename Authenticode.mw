{{Quotation
|quote=Authenticode allows vendors of downloadable executable code (plug-ins or ActiveX controls, for example) to attach digital certificates to their products to assure end users that the code is from the original developer and has not been altered. Authenticode lets end users decide for themselves whether to accept or reject software components posted on the Internet before downloading begins.

= Usage =
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe <code>signtool.exe</code>] can be used to <code>sign</code> and </code>Verify</code> applications.

Note, that the Windows website uses a lowercase <code>s</code> for <code>sign</code> but a capital <code>V</code> for the <code>Verify</code> subcommands.

Detailed installation and usage instructions for Authenticode, <code>signtool.exe</code> are [[undocumented]] in the {{project name long}} wiki. Using Authenticode is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].

= User Account Control =
User Account Control (UAC) is related to <code>Authenticode</code>.

= Authenticode versus User Account Control =
Microsoft SignTool used to verify the digital signature of a file. Specifically, it verifies if the signing certificate was issued by a trusted authority, has not been revoked, and if the signing certificate is valid.

While using signtool verify manually could add an extra layer of security, it's fair to presume that most users don't do this. <ref>
How often do you see a website offering programs for Windows for download and also offering digital software signatures versus not doing so?
</ref>

Windows automatically checks the digital signatures of drivers and downloaded applications, especially those requiring elevated privileges to install. This is part of User Account Control (UAC). However, this automatic checking is not as in-depth as manually using <code>signtool Verify</code>.

= Authenticode versus other Verification Tools =
Authenticode relies on [[SSL|The Broken Certificate Authority System]] which relies on trusted third-parties.

Other verification standards or tools such as [[OpenPGP]] or [[signify]] can provide end-to-end digital software signatures without need for any trusted third-parties. If such signatures are available, these should be preferred.

= VirtualBox =
VirtualBox for Windows is not signed with OpenPGP / gpg / signify. It is signed with authenticode. This is very common practice for most applications available for download for Windows.
