{{intro|
A standard [[Operating_System_Software_and_Updates|upgrade]] ensures that all packages within a major release are up-to-date, while a release upgrade upgrades from one major version to another.

However, due to technical limitations, a standard ("everyday") upgrade cannot perform the same functions as a release upgrade. The release upgrade procedure upgrades a significantly larger number of packages, often removes certain packages, and requires the user to follow additional steps as outlined in the release upgrade documentation.
