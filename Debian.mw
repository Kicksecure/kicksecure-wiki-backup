{{intro|
An existing Debian version <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> (codename: <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>) installation can be converted into [[Main_Page|{{project_name_long}}]] by installing a {{project_name_long}} deb package. This procedure is also called [[Distribution_Morphing|distro-morphing]].

There is no downloadable <code>iso</code> yet but it will be available in the future. In the meantime install Debian on the host or inside a VM, then install {{project_name_long}} on top.

= Introduction =

{{Disclaimer}}

To increase the chances of success, it is best to start with a minimal Debian installation either,

* A) Debian {{gui}} <u>Xfce</u>
* B) or Debian {{cli}}

and then install a {{project name long}} meta package as documented below.

It is easiest to set the Linux user account name to <code>user</code> during the installation of Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

{{Prerequisites}}

= Installation =
== Add the {{project_name_long}} Repository ==
{{Project-APT-Repository-Add}}

== Install the {{project_name_long}} Package ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Pick a {{project_name_long}} package.

* CLI version. Command line interface (CLI) version only. This does not modify the graphical desktop environment. This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and [[Main_Page#Hardening_by_Default|other security features]].
** For host operating systems: <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>
** For Qubes users: <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code>
** For any other VMs (not Qubes): <code>kicksecure-cli-vm</code>
* GUI version. Similar to the CI version but it installs the Xfce graphical desktop environment and default applications. This is useful if Debian was installed without a graphical desktop environment and the {{project_name_long}} graphical desktop environment (Xfce) is desired.
** For host operating systems: <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>
** For Qubes users: <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code>
** For any other VMs (not Qubes): <code>kicksecure-xfce-vm</code>

'''2.''' Install a {{project_name_long}} package such as <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
kicksecure-cli-host
}}

'''3.''' Next.

Meta package installation has been completed. Please proceed with the post-installation steps below.
}}

== Post-Installation ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Disable the extrepo {{project_name_short_lowercase}} APT repository.

This is to avoid a duplicate {{project name long}}  repository because the [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project name long}} repository tool]] has been created file <code>/etc/apt/sources.list/derivative.list</code>, which contains the {{project name long}} APT repository configuration.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo extrepo disable {{project_name_short_lowercase}}
}}

'''2.''' Check APT sources.

Check if some APT sources in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> should be kept.

Move the original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file out of the way (or delete it) because it is replaced by {{project_name_long}}'s <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

'''3.''' Create an empty <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

'''4.''' ''Optional:'' Set the onionized Debian repositories.

Follow [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Onionizing_Repositories#Onionize_debian.list these instructions] if Debian's onion repositories are preferred.

'''5.''' Done.

The {{project_name_long}} installation is complete.
