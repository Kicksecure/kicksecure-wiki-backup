{{intro|
An existing Debian version <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> (codename: <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>) installation can be converted into [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] by installing a {{project_name_short}} deb package. This procedure is also called [[Distribution_Morphing|distro-morphing]].
}}
= Introduction =
There are different options to install {{project_name_short}}. Two options. Choose one.

* '''A)''' (Easier) '''Download:''' Use the [[ISO]] or a different installation option from the [[Download]] page. In that case, you can stop reading this wiki page.; <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' (Advanced) '''Distribution morphing method:''' See below.

= Distribution Morphing Introduction = 
To increase the chances of success, it is best to start with a minimal Debian <u>installation</u> either,

* '''A)''' Debian {{gui}} (<u>Xfce</u>); <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Debian {{cli}}

and then install a {{project_name_short}} meta package as documented below.

It is easiest to set the Linux user account name to <code>user</code> during the installation of Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

<u>Debian Live sessions:</u> Distribution morphing a Debian Live ISO is unnecessary and [[unsupported]]. Use Kicksecure [[ISO]] instead. <ref>
Debian Live ISO (live session) is unnecessary and [[unsupported]]. Reasons:

* All changes will be lost on reboot.
* We already offer a live Kicksecure [[ISO]].
* None of the [[security-misc]] kernel hardening options will be enabled, and they can't be enabled, because that would require a reboot which will discard everything.
* permission-hardener doesn't expect anything under /usr to be read-only.

Use Kicksecure [[ISO]] instead.
</ref>

= User Account Information =
There are some specifics about distro-morphing which the user should be aware.

<u>During distro-morphing:</u>

* '''No creation of usable accounts for the user:''' Neither Linux user account <code>user</code> nor <code>sysmaint</code> will be created. <ref>
https://github.com/Kicksecure/dist-base-files/blob/master/debian/dist-base-files.postinst
</ref> The user can continue to use their already existing user account(s).
* '''No password changes:''' No passwords for any already existing user accounts will be modified. The user can continue to use their already existing passwords. This means passwords for [[Full Disk Encryption]] (pre-boot authentication), <code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, [[Login]], etc. will remain the same.
* '''No root account locking:''' The password of the root account will not be locked. The user can manually [[Root#Disable_Root_Account|Disable Root Account]] for better security.
* '''Autologin:''' {{project_name_short}} package <code>usability-misc</code> will set up auto-login for user <code>user</code> for LightDM, {{project_name_short}}'s default login manager at time of writing. Auto login can be disabled by the user by following the documentation for [[Desktop#Disable_Autologin|Disable Autologin]]

= Live Mode Information =
* Swap partition / swap files set up by Debian installer or use are <u>not</u> disabled during distribution morphing.

= Prerequisites =

{{Prerequisites}}

= Installation =
== Add the {{project_name_short}} Repository ==
{{Project-APT-Repository-Add}}

== Install the {{project_name_short}} Package ==

'''1.''' Pick a {{project_name_short}} package.

{{Tab
|type=controller
|content=
{{Tab
|title= ===GUI version===
|type=section
|image=
|addToClass=info-box
|active=true
|content=

Installs the Xfce graphical desktop environment and default applications. This is useful if Debian was installed without a graphical desktop environment and the {{project_name_short}} graphical desktop environment (Xfce) is desired.

}} <!-- close tab GUI version/section -->

{{Tab
|title= ===CLI version===
|image=
|addToClass=info-box
|content=

Command line interface (CLI) version only. This does not modify the graphical desktop environment. This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and [[About#Hardening_by_Default|other security features]].

'''2.''' Troubleshooting. (Optional.)

Only in case of issues, see footnote. <ref>
If apt returns an error about console-common when trying to install the Kicksecure package, install console-common first:

<code>sudo apt install console-common</code>

Then try installing the Kicksecure package again. Meta package installation has been completed. Please proceed with the post-installation steps below.
</ref> Otherwise proceed to next step.

'''3.''' Next.

== Post-Installation ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Enable the <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list</code> {{project_name_short}} APT repository.

Can be done using the [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project_name_short}} repository tool]].

Two options. Choose one. Either using,

* '''A)''' <u>CLI:</u> {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo repository-dist --enable --repository stable
}}, <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' <u>GUI:</u> <code>Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Derivative Repository</code> &rarr; <code>choose either "stable", "stable-proposed-updates" , "Testers" or "Developers" repository</code>

See the tool's wiki page for more detailed documentation if needed.

'''2.''' Disable the extrepo <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}</code> APT repository.

Only needed in case the user has chosen the extrepo signing key adding method above.

This is to avoid a duplicate {{project_name_short}} repository.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo extrepo disable {{project_name_short_lowercase}}
}}

'''3.''' Check APT sources.

Check if some APT sources in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> should be kept.

Move the original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file out of the way (or delete it) because it is replaced by {{project_name_short}}'s <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

'''4.''' Create an empty <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Set the onionized Debian repositories.

If onion repository sources are preferred, follow these {{whonix_wiki
|wikipage=Onionizing_Repositories#Onionize_debian.list
|text=Debian onion repositories instructions.
}}.

'''6.''' Done.

The {{project_name_short}} installation is complete.
