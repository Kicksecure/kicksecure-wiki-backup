{{intro|
An existing Debian version <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian version short}}</code> (codename: <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>) installation can be converted into [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] by installing a {{project_name_short}} deb package. This procedure is also called [[Distribution_Morphing|distro-morphing]].

There is no downloadable <code>iso</code> yet but it will be available in the future. In the meantime install Debian on the host or inside a VM, then install {{project_name_short}} on top.

= Introduction =

{{Disclaimer}}

To increase the chances of success, it is best to start with a minimal Debian installation either,

* A) Debian {{gui}} <u>Xfce</u>
* B) or Debian {{cli}}

and then install a {{project_name_short}} meta package as documented below.

It is easiest to set the Linux user account name to <code>user</code> during the installation of Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code>.

{{Prerequisites}}

= Installation =
== Add the {{project_name_short}} Repository ==
{{Project-APT-Repository-Add}}

== Install the {{project_name_short}} Package ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Pick a {{project_name_short}} package.

* CLI version. Command line interface (CLI) version only. This does not modify the graphical desktop environment. This package provides better kernel hardening, improved entropy, and [[About#Hardening_by_Default|other security features]].
** For host operating systems: <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>
** For Qubes users: <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code>
** For any other VMs (not Qubes): <code>kicksecure-cli-vm</code>
* GUI version. Similar to the CLI version but it installs the Xfce graphical desktop environment and default applications. This is useful if Debian was installed without a graphical desktop environment and the {{project_name_short}} graphical desktop environment (Xfce) is desired.
** For host operating systems: <code>kicksecure-xfce-host</code>
** For Qubes users: <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code>
** For any other VMs (not Qubes): <code>kicksecure-xfce-vm</code>

'''2.''' Install a {{project_name_short}} package such as <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>.

{{Install Package|package=
kicksecure-cli-host
}}

'''3.''' Troubleshooting. (Optional.)

Only in case of issues, see footnote. <ref>
If apt returns an error about console-common when trying to install the Kicksecure package, install console-common first:

<code>sudo apt install console-common</code>

Then try installing the Kicksecure package again. Meta package installation has been completed. Please proceed with the post-installation steps below.
</ref> Otherwise proceed to next step.

'''4.''' Next.
}}

== Post-Installation ==

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Enable the <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list</code> {{project_name_short}} APT repository.

Can be done using the [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project_name_short}} repository tool]].

Two options. Choose one. Either using,

* '''A)''' <u>CLI:</u> {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo repository-dist --enable --repository stable
}}, <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' <u>GUI:</u> <code>Start Menu</code> &rarr; <code>System</code> &rarr; <code>Derivative Repository</code> &rarr; <code>choose either "stable", "stable-proposed-updates" , "Testers" or "Developers" repository</code>

See the tool's wiki page for more detailed documentation if needed.

'''2.''' Disable the extrepo <code>{{project_name_short_lowercase}}</code> APT repository.

This is to avoid a duplicate {{project_name_short}} repository.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo extrepo disable {{project_name_short_lowercase}}
}}

'''3.''' Check APT sources.

Check if some APT sources in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> should be kept.

Move the original <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file out of the way (or delete it) because it is replaced by {{project_name_short}}'s <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/
}}

'''4.''' Create an empty <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list
}}

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Set the onionized Debian repositories.

Follow [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Onionizing_Repositories#Onionize_debian.list these instructions] if Debian's onion repositories are preferred.

'''6.''' Done.

The {{project_name_short}} installation is complete.
