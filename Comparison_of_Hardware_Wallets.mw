{{intro|
Quick comparison of hardware wallets.
}}

= Introduction =
The primary purpose of the comparison table it to show that even if the firmware of a hardware wallet is 100 % Open Source, Freedom Software, supports reproducible builds, that the user still cannot verify that the user is running the official firmware.

{{Quotation
|quote=
And open source doesn’t really solve this. It’s impossible to have guarantees that the electronic itself is not backdoored, nor that the firmware that runs inside the wallet is the one you audited.

= Criteria for Inclusion =
Please do not attempt to make this a complete comparison table. Less popular vendors or vendors with no innovative security features in context of the comparison table will be disregarded.

Initially this might have been possible and is still documented on the website.

You can install unofficial firmware on OneKey devices, but doing so will erase device storage and display a warning every time you boot.

= Source of Information =
Public statements from the vendor primarily on their website or source code repository are acceptable. However, the author be made aware of contradicting expert opinions or other evidence, then public statements from the vendor are insufficient.

! Criteria
! Details

! security audited
|
"Security audit" is not a simple yes or no. It depends on the scope of the audit and who made it. It's therefore not included in above comparison table. See also:
{{audit_mininav}}
|-

! Warning if running custom firmware.
| Users running the official firmware should get a warning if an attacker flashed a custom firmware from their device's bootloader.
|-

! Installation of custom firmware deletes storage.
| This is a security feature to avoid a malicious custom firmware stealing the private keys.
|-

! Detach storage
| Can storage be detached, duplicated and re-attached? If de-soldering of the storage chip is possible, this may or may not be a security issue because a custom firmware by an attacker might decrypt, steal the private keys.
