|quote=Speed and its security impact

Cryptographic performance problems have frequently caused users to reduce their cryptographic security levels or to turn off cryptography entirely.

|quote=The remaining risk is that users find NaCl too slow and turn it off, replacing it with low-security cryptographic software or no cryptography at all. NaCl avoids this type of disaster by providing exceptionally high speeds.

|quote=
Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys. Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that! We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break one key! Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography. But are the users going to say "Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack"? I'm skeptical. I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value.

|quote=Speed drives adoption, Daniel J. Bernstein (djb) probably understand this more than anyone else. And this is what led Adam Langley to decide to either stay on SHA-2 or move to BLAKE2. Is that a good advice? Should we all follow his steps?

* Are “random” primes dangerous?
* Are primes required to be 3 mod 4?

These questions go far beyond 128 vs 256 vs 512 bits of security.
