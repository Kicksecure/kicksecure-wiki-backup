= Overview =

sdwdate-gui is an optional graphical user interface (GUI) for [[sdwdate]].

sdwdate can optionally be configured to [[Network_Time_Synchronization#Block_Networking_until_sdwdate_Finishes|block networking until sdwdate finishes]], preventing potential leakage of the time before it is changed.

= Rationale =
sdwdate-gui's purpose is to provide users with a clear, interactive way to monitor and manage time synchronization.

'''1. Visual Monitoring:'''

* Displays the status of [[sdwdate]] (a secure time-synchronization tool).
* Shows whether the system time has been synchronized with secure onion time sources.

'''2. User-Friendly Notifications:'''

* Shows systray error icon if there are issues with time synchronization.
* Helps ensure the user knows whether network time synchronization has been completed, a critical factor for security.
* The GUI makes this process more transparent and accessible to users who prefer a graphical interface.

'''3. Debugging and Control:'''

* Offers a way to manually interact with or troubleshoot sdwdate if needed.
* Provides easy access to diagnostic information (log) for advanced users to ensure the synchronization service is functioning as intended.
* Encourages advanced users to monitor, review, audit sdwdate's operation.

In summary, sdwdate-gui simplifies the interaction with the sdwdate service, ensuring secure and anonymous time synchronization.

= Troubleshooting =
== {{q_project_name_long}} - Unexpected Autostart of {{project_name_gateway_vm}} ==
Follow instructions [[Multiple Whonix-Workstation#Qubes-Whonix|multiple {{q_project_name_short}} {{project_name_workstation_long}}]]. <ref>
Qubes bug report: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5253
</ref>

= Configuration =
== Disable Autostart ==
The following instructions disable autostart of sdwdate-gui but do not [[Sdwdate#Disable_Autostart|disable autostart of sdwdate]].

'''1.''' Platform specific notice.

* [[Qubes]] users note: Apply the following steps {{project_name_gateway_long}} (<code>{{project_name_gateway_template}}</code>) Template. <ref>
To change this setting per App Qube instead for all App Qubes, alternatively Qubes users might want to use folder <code>/usr/local/etc/sdwdate-gui.d</code> in App Qubes instead of the Template since that folder in AppVM would persist after reboot and does not require changes in Template.<br />
<br />
'''1.''' Create folder <code>/usr/local/etc/sdwdate-gui.d</code>.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/sdwdate-gui.d
}}

'''2.''' Then edit file <code>/usr/local/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/50_user.conf</code> instead of <code>/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/50_user.conf</code>.
</ref>
* Other {{project_name_long}} users note: No special notice.

'''2.''' Create file <code>/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/50_user.conf</code>. <ref>
https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/sdwdate-gui/blob/master/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/30_default.conf
</ref>

{{Open with root rights|filename=
/etc/sdwdate-gui.d/50_user.conf
}}

'''3.''' Paste.

{{CodeSelect|code=
disable=true
}}

'''4.''' Save.

'''5.''' Done.

The process of disabling autostart of sdwdate-gui is now complete.
