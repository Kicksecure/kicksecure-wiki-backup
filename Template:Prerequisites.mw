{{Box|text=
The user needs to verify that the following prerequisites are met.

* Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> installed.
* A user account such as for example user <code>user</code> exists.
* Calling the user name <code>user</code> is recommended because then you could copy and paste the commands below and do not need to adjust for another user name.
}}

'''2.''' Gain administrative (root) rights. <ref>
Use any method to gain administrative (root) rights. Gain root one way or another.
</ref>

{{Box|text=
Becoming root is required because the following commands need to be run with administrative (root) rights as documented below. <ref>
When a user is using <code>su</code> to gain administrative rights, the user is required to use full path to the programs <code>addgroup</code>, <code>adduser</code>, <code>reboot</code> because when using <code>su</code> the <code>PATH</code> environment variable is not adjusted for use with root rights. See <code>echo "$PATH"</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
echo "$PATH"
}}

user rights <code>PATH</code> printout:

<pre>
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
</pre>

root rights <code>PATH</code> printout:

<pre>
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
</pre>

By comparison, when using <code>sudo</code> using /full/path/to/application is not required.
</ref>

* '''A)''' <u>Debian:</u> Use <code>su</code> or <code>sudo su</code> as documented below.
* '''B)''' <u>Most Qubes users:</u> same as above.
* '''C)''' <u>Advanced Qubes users:</u> If using a Debian minimal template or not having the <code>passwordless-root</code> package installed, see footnote. <ref>
A root terminal is required to proceed which can be started from Qubes dom0 terminal as per the Qubes upstream documentation. [[Unspecific|Unspecific to {{project_name_short}}.]]
</ref>

Try to come root by running the following command in a terminal.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
su
}}

Executing plain <code>su</code> might not be possible depending on how Debian has been installed. <ref>
If a root password has not configured during Debian installation, Debian-Installer might have already set up <code>sudo</code>.
</ref> In that case, try.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
sudo su
}}
}}

'''3.''' Install <code>sudo</code> and </code>adduser</code> package.
<!-- WIKI EDITORS NOTE:
Can use template Install_Package because that would use sudo which is not installed at this point.
-->

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Update the package lists.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
apt update
}}

'''2.''' Upgrade the system.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
apt full-upgrade
}}

'''3.''' Install <code>sudo</code> and </code>adduser</code> package.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
apt install --no-install-recommends sudo adduser
}}
}}

'''4.''' Root rights hardening notice.

{{Box|text=
'''Note:'''

* '''A)''' <u>Most users:</u> No special notice.
* '''B)''' <u>Advanced users:</u> If the user is intending to lockdown user <code>user</code> by not granting root rights, see footnote. <ref>
The following command <code>/usr/sbin/adduser user sudo</code> grants root rights to user <code>user</code>. If the user intents to use user <code>user</code> without root rights for better security, the user should <u>omit</u> running the <code>/usr/sbin/adduser user sudo</code> and instead 1) make sure that another Linux user account such as user <code>sysmaint</code> is a member of Linux user group <code>sudo</code> and 2) adhere to the following platform specific instructions.

* Debian: Use <code>su</code>.
* {{q_project_name_long}}: If not installing the <code>passwordless-root</code> package and/or when distribution morphing a Debian minimal template into {{project_name_short}}, root terminal is required to proceed which can be started from Qubes dom0 terminal as per the Qubes upstream documentation. [[Unspecific|Unspecific to {{project_name_short}}.]]
</ref>
}}

'''5.''' sudo configuration.

<u>Optional.</u>

Allow user <code>user</code> to run sudo without as password.

<u>Note:</u> Replace user <code>user</code> with your actual user name.

Securely create file <code>/etc/sudoers.d/user.conf</code> using <code>visudo</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
echo "user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" {{!}} EDITOR=tee visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/nopassword >/dev/null
}}
}}
{{Tab
|title= ==Adduser Method==
|content=
Add user <code>user</code> to group <code>sudo</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
/usr/sbin/adduser user sudo
}}

Reboot required.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
/sbin/reboot
}}

Gain administrative rights after reboot. Same as in step 2.
}}
}}

'''6.''' Create group <code>console</code>.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
/usr/sbin/addgroup --system console
}}

'''7.''' Add your Linux account user name to group <code>console</code>. <ref>
Context: [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Console_Lockdown|Console Lockdown]]

Required for login into a [[Desktop#Virtual_Consoles|Virtual Consoles]] which might be handy in context of [[Recovery]].
</ref>

<u>Note:</u> Replace user <code>user</code> with your actual user name.

{{CodeSelect|lang=bash|code=
/usr/sbin/adduser user console
}}

'''8.''' Install console related packages.

This might also result in removal of <code>plymouth</code>, which is good, because it is [[unsupported]]. <ref>
