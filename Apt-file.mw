HowTo: install apt-file. It can be used to show which files are included by a package.
}}
= Introduction =
<code>apt-file</code> can be used to show which files are included by a package.

From the Debian package description [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/apt-file <code>apt-file</code>]:

<blockquote>search for files within Debian packages (command-line interface)

apt-file is a command line tool for searching files contained in packages for the APT packaging system. You can search in which package a file is included or list the contents of a package without installing or fetching it.</blockquote>

= Installation =

Because it contains settings that [https://forums.whonix.org/t/speeding-up-apt-update-with-acquire-languages-none-and-contents-deb-defaultenabled-false-its-so-much-faster/8894 speed up APT] but break <code>apt-file</code> and <code>command-not-found</code>.

<pre>
Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-deb::DefaultEnabled false;
</pre>

This breaks <code>apt-file</code> because it requires <code>/var/lib/apt/lists/*Contents*</code> to exist.
