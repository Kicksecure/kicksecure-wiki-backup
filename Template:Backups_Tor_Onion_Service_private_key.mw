Reminder: Always backup the onion service key. This is necessary in order to restore it on another machine, on a newer {{project_name_gateway_long}}, after HDD/SSD failure, etc. Follow the instructions below to find its location; root permission is required to access it.

<code>
{{{private_key_file}}}
</code>
{{Box|text=
<u>[[Qubes|{{qubes_project_name}}]]</u>

Use the usual Qubes tools. The following example shows how to copy the {{Code2|{{{private_key_file}}}}} from the {{Code2|{{project_name_gateway_vm}}}} VM to the {{Code2|vault}} VM (which should be started beforehand) using {{Code2|qvm-copy-to-vm}}.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo qvm-copy-to-vm vault {{{private_key_file}}}
}}

The above step copies the Tor onion service private key file to the {{Code2|QubesIncoming}} folder of the {{Code2|vault}} VM.

{{CodeSelect|code=
/home/user/QubesIncoming/{{project_name_gateway_vm}}/{{{file_name}}}
}}

Consider moving the file from the {{Code2|QubesIncoming}} folder to another preferred location.

Qubes VM Manager can be used to conveniently backup the {{Code2|vault}} and/or other VMs. Please refer to the Qubes backups documentation for necessary steps to accomplish that.
