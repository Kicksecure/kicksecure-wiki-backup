* VirtualBox uses VMDK version 3. This is non-ideal, because working with these images is difficult.
** Converting these images is difficult.
*** <s>qemu-img version 1.6.1 ({{Code|qemu-img convert "vmdk_file" -O RAW "vdi_file"}}) fails with: {{Code2|qemu-img: 'image' uses a vmdk feature which is not supported by this qemu version: VMDK version 3}}, which is a [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1253465 known issue in qemu].</s> As per [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1253465 this], QEMU version equal or bigger than {{Code2|2.8}} should be capable to work with VMDK version 3 disks.

== VirtualBox Unavailable in Debian stable and backports due to Debian Stable Security Maintenance Issues ==
Quote https://people.debian.org/~lucas/virtualbox-buster/

<blockquote>
Virtualbox is not available in Debian 10 (nor in backports). The reasons are discussed at length in https://bugs.debian.org/794466 and various other mailing list threads, but can be summarized as:

* Virtualbox is not suitable for Debian stable releases because of the lack of cooperation of Oracle on security support (that’s the Debian security team decision).
* Since it is not suitable for stable releases, it cannot be included in the testing suite (that’s the Debian release team decision).
* It also cannot be included in official backports, as packages must be in testing before they get backported (that’s the Debian backports team’s decision).
</blockquote>

There is hope this will improve in future: [https://salsa.debian.org/fasttrack-team/support/issues/10 please add VirtualBox to fasttrack]

== VirtualBox Unavailable in Debian main due to Licensing Issues ==
'''compilation toolchain software freedom issue'''

There's a compilation toolchain software freedom issue. This is not a security issue.

[https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/08/msg00106.html Quote Debian mailing list]:

<blockquote>Virtualbox ships a BIOS that requires Watcom to compile from real sources, precompiled copy they ship as well is free but is not the preferred form for modification.</blockquote>

'''Sybase Open Watcom Public License'''

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybase_Open_Watcom_Public_License Sybase Open Watcom Public License] license is:

* OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved: Yes.
* FSF (Free Software Foundation) approved: No.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines Debian FSG compatible]: No.

'''Does Debian build VirtualBox using Open Watcom?'''

No. Quote [https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-virtualbox-team/virtualbox/-/blob/master/debian/copyright <code>debian/copyright</code> file] from [https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-virtualbox-team/virtualbox Debian VirtualBox Repository]:

<blockquote>
This package is not part of the Debian operating system.
It is in the "contrib" area of the Debian archive because it requires a
non-free compiler (Open Watcom) to build the BIOS.
Upstream provides pre-built BIOS images which is used instead.
</blockquote>

Debian is already using <code>VBoxBiosAlternative</code>:

Quote https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbox/+bug/1605337 / https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/virtualbox/+bug/1605337/comments/3

<blockquote>
<oracle> LocutusOfBorg: btw, there are no BIOS binaries in the vbox source tree. only the VBoxBiosAlternative.* files, which are used if you don't have OpenWatcom.
</blockquote>

'''Licensing Issue or Security Issues?'''

It is a licensing issue only.

Quote VirtualBox developer [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=691148#35 <code>Frank Mehnert <frank.mehnert@oracle.com></code>]:

<blockquote>In my opinion this depends on the definition of the term "source code".

The VirtualBox source code tarball ships two alternative variants of
the BIOS source code: The first variant is C code mixed with Assembler
code (in src/VBox/Devices/PC/BIOS/* and src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/BIOS/*).
The second variant is pure Assembler code which can be found in

  src/VBox/Devices/PC/BIOS/VBoxBiosAlternative.asm and
  src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/BIOS/VBoxVgaBiosAlternative.asm

Both variants are part of the source code tarball, and the second variant
allows it to build VirtualBox even if Open Watcom is not available. It
should not matter that the second variant is generated from the first
variant because that generation is done by the VirtualBox team and we
ensure that the 2nd variant will produce the same object code as the 1st
variant.
</blockquote>

'''Software Freedom Issues with the Sybase License'''

Quote [[KVM#Why_Use_KVM_Over_VirtualBox.3F|Whonix KVM]]:

<blockquote>The VirtualBox developer team have recently taken the decision to switch out the BIOS in their hypervisor. However, it now comes with one that requires compilation by a toolchain that [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Unavailable_in_Debian_main_due_to_Licensing_Issues|does not meet the definition of Free Software]] as per the guidelines of the Free Software Foundation. This move is considered problematic for free and open source software projects like Debian, on which {{project_name_short}} is based.

The issues of the Open Watcom License are explained in [https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-legal@lists.debian.org/msg34687.html this thread] on the Debian Mailinglist. In summary, there are issues surrounding the contradictory language of the license, the assertion of patents against software that rely upon it, and the placing of certain restrictions on software uses. For these reasons, those who care about running FOSS and appreciate its ethical views are recommended to avoid running VirtualBox; also see  [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|avoid non-freedom software]].</blockquote>

'''Copyright Holder of the Open Watcom Compiler'''

The company which was the original developer of Open Watcom, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybase Sybase], does no longer exist. It was been purchased by SAP.

'''SAP Plans for the Open Watcom Compiler'''

Sebastian Wolf (SAP Open Source Program Office) expressed that SAP expressed on github [https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/discussions/271#discussioncomment-710110 starting from this message] in 2021 that SAP is in process of re-licensing Open Watcom to resolve the licensing issues.

'''Does SAP support or attack Freedom Software?'''

SAP according to the knowledge of the author of this wiki chapter has no history of attacking Freedom Software or patent trolling. On the contrary, [https://openinventionnetwork.com/community-directory/ SAP is a community member] of the [https://openinventionnetwork.com/ Open Invention Network], which [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Invention_Network quote wikipedia]:

<blockquote>Open Invention Network (OIN) is a company that acquires patents and licenses them royalty-free to its community members who, in turn, agree not to assert their own patents against Linux and Linux-related systems and applications.</blockquote>

'''Conclusion'''

Debian does not use the Open Watcom compiler which is under a problematic license to build VirtualBox. 

Since the current copyright holder of Open Watcom, SAP does not have a history of attacking Freedom Software, is a member of OIN and is intending to change the license of the Open Watcom.

Therefore the risk from patent trolling in this case seems to be minuscule.

The Freedom Software community pointing out software freedom issues is commendable. However, there is no security issue in this case because of this software freedom issue.

<blockquote>A part of Guest Additions source code is the part of OSE repository and licensed under GPLv2. Guest Additions build also includes big list of 3rd party files under various permissive licenses

At the same time VirtualBox binary packages which are distributed freely includes Guest Additions ISO, and Licensing FAQ (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ) clearly states: Yes. The GPLv2 allows you to distribute the VirtualBox Guest Additions, in modified or unmodified form, as long as you adhere to the terms and conditions of the GPLv2.

I hope that answers your question.</blockquote>

== VirtualBox Open Source vs Closed Source ==
* <code>VirtualBox</code> is Open Source.
* <code>VirtualBox Guest Additions</code> are Open Source.
** Installed by default in {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox.
** See [[#VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom|VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom]].
* <code>VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</code> is proprietary.
** Not installed by default in {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox.
** Neither used nor required by most users.

Open Source here means, the full corresponding source code is released under Free Software Foundation (FSF), Open Source Initiative (OSI) and The Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) approved licenses.

However the is a build toolchain issue elaborated in chapter [[#VirtualBox Unavailable in Debian main due to Licensing Issues|VirtualBox Unavailable in Debian main due to Licensing Issues]].

{{Anchor|VirtualBox Installation Challenges}}

= VirtualBox Integration =
* version 16: VirtualBox and guest additions in {{project_name_short}} 16 and above are acquired from <code>fasttrack.debian.net</code>. This heavily simplifies the [[#Previous VirtualBox Integration|Previous VirtualBox Integration]].
* version 17: TODO: document

== Fasttrack ==
* https://fasttrack.debian.net
* https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian/pool/contrib/v/virtualbox/
* https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian/pool/non-free/v/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso/
** [[#VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom]]
* (https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian/pool/contrib/v/virtualbox-ext-pack/)
** Not required but available.

= Arguments for keeping VirtualBox Support =
* [[KVM]] is not available to Windows users.
* Simplicity, as in: [[VirtualBox]] has a VM import GUI feature.
* Available to users not owning computer providing hardware virtualization. ([[KVM]] requires that. [[QEMU]] may or may not but it is [[unsupported]].)
* Due to Windows users and simplicity it leads to greater popularity, which in theory attracts more users, developers, auditors, [[payments]], etc and is therefore good for the overall health of the project.
* Some Windows/[[VirtualBox]] users experimenting with their first Linux ({{project_name_short}}) will one day become users who mainly use Linux as their host operating system.

= VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack =
* <code>VirtualBox Guest Additions</code> and <code>VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</code> are different things.
* <code>VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack</code>:
** Is proprietary, nonfreedom software.
** Was never in <code>packages.debian.org</code>.
* Since VirtualBox version 7.0.0 support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices is included in the base package and no longer requires the Extension Pack.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

= Storage Controller Setting =
Since {{project_name_short}} version <code>15.0.1.7.3</code>: AHCI

Reasons:

* SATA AHCI is the default setting as defined by VirtualBox for new VirtualBox VMs using Debian 64-bit.
* This setting is better tested by upstream, VirtualBox developers than other settings.
* In past, a regression introduced in the LsiLogic SAS controller code had been introduced by VirtualBox developer which has not been found in testing VirtualBox before the release.
** This resulted in this usability issue for {{project_name_short}} users, [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#Failed_to_open_a_session_for_the_virtual_machine|Failed to open a session for the virtual machine / <code>NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)</code>]] ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-failed-to-start-ns-error-failure-0x80004005-the-vm-session-was-aborted/11471 Whonix VirtualBox - failed to start - NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005) - The VM session was aborted.])

Reason why {{project_name_short}} previously used a different setting LsiLogic SAS was avoidance of VirtualBox host software bug, [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031 High I/O causing filesystem corruption]. See also old {{Whonix}} issue tracker discussion, [https://web.archive.org/web/20210122015240/https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/274 VirtualBox AHCI].

The current default setting AHCI <u>might</u> lead to the issue [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption|High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption]] on some (slower) hardware configurations due to VirtualBox host software bug, [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10031 High I/O causing filesystem corruption]. It's speculation and unavoidable. There is no other solution at the moment. Wiki chapter [[VirtualBox/Troubleshooting#High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption|High Disk Usage Causing Filesystem Corruption]] already contains approaches which might fix this issue in case it manifests.)

VirtualBox core dump:

Kernel core dump:

<blockquote>
Privacy information: Also be aware that the above kernel dumps could contain unrelated sensitive and private information about you and your system, e.g. stored passwords in memory. Unfortunately this is unavoidable in those situations, as a kernel dump essentially is an unmodified and unfiltered part of your computer's RAM (main memory).

= VirtualBox Bug Reports =
VirtualBox (Guest Additions) have various issues. Often copy/paste from host to VM does not work or VMs are not automatically reized to optional size.

The internet is full of discussions that lead to no solution. Hard to find good information. It is unhelpful to ask in arbitrary places about it as this only leads to more discussions which go nowhere. The only option is to find out what information VirtualBox developers are asking for, to write a good bug report and to report to virtualbox.org developers.

* Step 1) Research what information VirtualBox developers would be asking for.
* Step 2) Write a good bug report.

== What Should Be Included In Bug Report ==
Include as many information as possible.

=== Issue ===
Goal: Installation of the VirtualBox host software with functional VirtualBox guest additions.

This was previously very difficult due to many issues of which none is caused by {{project_name_short}}. The purpose of this chapter is to document the current implementation for those wondering why it has been implemented this way and perhaps hearing if there are any better alternatives. Here is a summary of these issues:

What was the importance VirtualBox in Debian <code>buster</code>? It was the base distribution which {{project_name_short}} 15 was based on and the distribution used to build {{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox for [[Linux]], [[Windows]] and [[macOS]] from source code.

Related:

* VirtualBox feature request: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20475 add Debian 11 / bullseye to Linux Downloads / APT repository]

=== Implementation ===
TODO: update for {{project_name_short}} which uses Debian fasttrack repository to acquire VirtualBox.

To be able to continue providing [[VirtualBox|{{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox]], from {{project_name_short}} <code>15.0.1.4.8</code> and above the following implementation is in use:

* VirtualBox Host Software
** {{project_name_short}} build script will download VirtualBox host software package <code>virtualbox-6.1</code> from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads upstream virtualbox.org Debian repository]. <ref>
[[VirtualBox/Other_Versions#Install_from_Oracle_Repository|manual instructions]]
</ref> That repository contains recent, functional backports for Debian <code>buster</code>.
*** repository: https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian
*** <code>Packages</code> file: https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/dists/{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}/contrib/binary-amd64/Packages
**** At time of initial implementation contained <code>virtualbox-6.1_6.1.12-139181~Debian~buster_amd64.deb</code> (Scroll down. Ignore <code>Package: virtualbox-5.2</code>.). I.e. VirtualBox version <code>6.1.12</code>.
** Users of Debian <code>buster</code> will be advised to install the VirtualBox from the {{project_name_short}} APT repository on the [[VirtualBox|Whonix for VirtualBox download page]].
** {{project_name_short}} for VirtualBox download page will recommend a specific version of VirtualBox with a detailed explanation on a separate page [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version for use with {{project_name_short}}]].

* VirtualBox Guest Additions
** {{project_name_short}} build script will download package [https://packages.debian.org/sid/virtualbox-guest-additions-iso virtualbox-guest-additions-iso] from Debian <code>sid</code> (<code>unstable</code>) and upload to {{project_name_short}} APT repository. That package provides file <code>/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code>.
** At time of initial implementation contained VirtualBox guest additions ISO version <code>6.1.12-1</code>. In short, <code>6.1.12</code>. Ignore the <code>-1</code> which is a Debian package revision number and not the upstream (virtualbox.org) version number.
** virtualbox.org homepage also advertised version <code>6.1.12</code>.
** Package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> will be installed by default in new {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox builds.
** Related: [[#VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom|VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO Freedom vs Non-Freedom]]
** Documented here: [[VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#VirtualBox_Guest_Additions]]
* This is
** to allow {{project_name_short}} developers test newer versions of VirtualBox host software before these are installed on user's computer and,
** to allow updating VirtualBox host software and VirtualBox guest additions at the same time, using compatible versions.
* Package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist vm-config-dist] will run [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist/blob/master/usr/bin/vbox-guest-installer vbox-guest-installer] (by {{project_name_short}} developers) during upgrade ([https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist/blob/master/debian/vm-config-dist.postinst vm-config-dist.postinst]) and therefore also during the {{project_name_short}} VirtualBox <code>ova</code> build process.
* Package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist vm-config-dist] has a dpkg trigger since {{project_name_short}} <code>15.0.1.5.1</code> [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/vm-config-dist/blob/master/debian/vm-config-dist.triggers vm-config-dist.triggers] which results in running <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> when package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is upgraded.

# <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> (by {{project_name_short}} developers) will check if any of the packages <code>virtualbox-guest-x11</code>, <code>virtualbox-guest-utils</code> or <code>virtualbox-guest-dkms</code> are still installed and recommend to uninstall those if still installed.
# And also check if package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> is installed and recommend to install it if not yet installed.
# If these two conditions are met it will continue.
# Next is deletion of folder <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-iso</code> and <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-makeself</code> if these are already existing from a previous run.
# It then follows extraction of <code>/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code> to folder <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-iso</code>.
# Making <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-iso/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code> executable.
# Change directory into <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-iso</code>.
# Executing <code>./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --check</code>.
# Extracting <code>./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code> to folder <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-makeself</code>.
# Change directory into folder <code>/var/cache/vm-config-dist/vbox-guest-additions-extracted-makeself</code>.
# Executing <code>./install.sh force force</code>.
# Installation of VirtualBox guest additions from package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code> should now be completed.
# Installation using this method also ships required hooks in folder <code>/etc/kernel</code> to rebuild VirtualBox guest additions during kernel upgrade thanks to <code>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code>.

Credits: Gratitude is expressed to VirtualBox developers for providing <code>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</code> and to Debian Developers for providing package <code>virtualbox-guest-additions-iso</code>. The script to improve usability of this named <code>vbox-guest-installer</code> was created by the {{project_name_short}} project.

= Compare VM Settings =
'''1.''' Install a graphical difference viewer (or use command line <code>diff</code> if you prefer).

{{Install Package|package=
meld kdiff3
}}

'''2.''' Learn the basic <code>vboxmanage showvminfo</code> syntax.

Just to show the syntax. Nothing to do. An actual example will be shown in step 4.

<pre>
vboxmanage showvminfo vmname
</pre>

Notes:

* <code>vmname</code> needs to be replaced with the actual name of the VM.
* What is being shown here is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] and a VirtualBox feature.

'''3.''' Learn how to redirect the output of <code>vboxmanage showvminfo</code> to a file.

<pre>
vboxmanage showvminfo vmname &> filename.txt
</pre>

Notes:

* <code>vmname</code> needs to be replaced with the actual name of the VM.
* After the <code>&></code> it follows the filename.
* File redirection is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]] and a standard shell feature.

'''4.''' Dump VM settings to file to human readable format.

Notes:

* Replace the name of the VM <code>Kicksecure-Xfce</code> with the actual name of your VM.

For VM 1.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage showvminfo Kicksecure-Xfce &> kicksecure-human.txt
}}

For VM2.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage showvminfo Debian &> debian-human.txt
}}

'''5.''' Dump VM settings to file to machine readable format.

For VM1 with <code>--machinereadable</code> parameter as an alternative.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage showvminfo --machinereadable Kicksecure-Xfce &> kicksecure-machine.txt
}}

For VM2 with <code>--machinereadable</code> parameter as an alternative.

{{CodeSelect|code=
vboxmanage showvminfo --machinereadable Debian &> debian-machine.txt
}}

'''6.''' View the differences.

{{CodeSelect|code=
meld debian-human.txt kicksecure-human.txt
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
kdiff3 debian-human.txt kicksecure-human.txt
}}

View the differences in case using machinereadable.

{{CodeSelect|code=
meld debian-machine.txt kicksecure-machine.txt
}}

{{CodeSelect|code=
kdiff3 meld debian-machine.txt kicksecure-machine.txt
}}

'''7.''' Done.
