{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be booted in Persistent Mode.'''

Think of persistent mode like using your own computer - everything you do is saved. Live mode is more like browsing in private or incognito mode, where nothing is saved after you close it.

In persistent mode mode, all changes made during a session are saved and retained across reboots, ensuring that files, settings, and other data persist. This is the most common way to use an operating system, functioning like a standard installation. If you prefer a temporary session where changes are not saved, consider switching to [[Live Mode]].
}}

Most other operating systems do not even call this "persistent mode" because they do not offer a non-persistent live mode as an alternative. In such systems, persistence is implied. However, {{project_name_short}} provides the flexibility to switch between persistent and live modes depending on your needs.

Booting into persistent mode is straightforward. During the boot menu, simply do not choose the live mode option. The default boot option will result in launching {{project_name_short}} in persistent mode.

There is one exception: When booting from the [[ISO]], the system will always default to ISO live mode, meaning changes will not be saved.

After booting from the ISO, the user can [[ISO|install {{project_name_long}} to a hard drive]] or [[USB Installation|install it on another USB drive]]. After installation, the user can choose between persistent mode and live mode, as shown in the first image on this page.
