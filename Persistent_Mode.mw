{{project_name_short}} can be booted in Persistent Mode.

In that mode, all changes to the disk will be preserved after a reboot. This is the most common way to use an operating system. Persistent mode is simply the opposite of Live Mode. If you prefer a temporary session where changes are not saved, consider switching to [[Live Mode]].

Most other operating systems do not even call this "persistent mode". This is because, most operating systems are not offering an optional live. Hence, tfor these operating system it does not make sense to have documentation on persistent mode versus live mode.
