== Pay What You Want Model ==
Pay what you want (or PWYW).

Similar to [[#Donations]].

Examples:

* [https://elementary.io/ elementary OS]

== Crowd Funding Model ==
Similar to [[#Donations]].

== Selling Copies Model ==
Selling Copies. Other synonyms are <code>Selling the Ready-to-Run Program</code> or more technical, <code>selling precompiled binary builds</code>.

While most Open Source software is available for free, some projects do charge users for access to pre-compiled binary versions or offer them under a commercial license, even though the source code is freely available. By comparison, selling copies (licensing fees) is one of the main business models for propriety, closed source software.

Note, that Free, Libre and Open Source (FLOSS) software must be free in price a a myth. See [[#Free and Open Source Software should be Free in Price|common misconception: Free and Open Source Software should be Free in Price]].

Selling Copies is rarely used Open Source business model. Only very few examples could be found under the criteria. <ref>
Example AI search query: {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
Ardour is open source, but one must pay to download the compiled program. Are there other open-source programs that require payment for download? Please exclude examples like the Blender cloud service, as that is not a downloadable program, and Unreal Engine, as it is source-available and not Open Source. Additionally, exclude Open Source business models such as hosting, support, open core, SaaS, and dual licensing. List only examples where payment is required for downloads, and where there is only one version available for download—excluding lite/pro/professional versions. Software released under OSI and/or FSF approved licenses only.

== Subscription Model ==
Similar to [[#Selling Copies]].

* Examples:
** Ardour is selling subscriptions. However, even if the subscription is canceled or expired, Ardour will keep functioning.

No other examples could be found. <ref>

Could you provide examples of Open Source software that utilize the Subscription Business Model? Please list only examples of software that run locally and require a subscription, excluding those offering support and services, hosting, SaaS, cloud, web-based solutions, and extra tools. The software listed should be under licenses approved by OSI or FSF, i.e., it should be Open Source or Free Software.

== Software as a Service - SaaS Model ==

== Support and Services Model ==
* RedHat - owned by IBM - megacorporation

== Open Core Model ==
* gitlab
* Similar to freemium.

== Grants Model ==
* Conditional sponsoring.
* Sponsors might get influence over the project's priorities.

== Dual Licensing Model ==
* MySQL - owned by Oracle - megacorporation

== Data Monetization Model ==
* No known Open Source examples.

== Search Partnership Model ==
Example: Firefox receiving most of its funding from Google, thereby becoming dependent on Google and unable to seriously tackle data mining issues.

== source-available software ==

Only for a source-available software business model.

= Misconceptions =
== Free and Open Source Software should be Free in Price ==
Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) movements primarily focus on the freedom to use, modify, and distribute software, rather than on the economic aspects such as the cost or revenue generation. However, these movements do not inherently oppose the idea of earning money through software; instead, they encourage the community to benefit from shared knowledge and collaboration.

The ethos of the Free Software movement acknowledges and supports the legitimacy of generating revenue through software distribution and services. As clarified by the GNU Project:

{{quotation
|quote=Many people believe that the spirit of the GNU Project is that you should not charge money for distributing copies of software, or that you should charge as little as possible—just enough to cover the cost. This is a misunderstanding.

Actually, we encourage people who redistribute free software to charge as much as they wish or can. If a license does not permit users to make copies and sell them, it is a nonfree license. If this seems surprising to you, please read on.
|context=GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html Selling Free Software]
}}

“Free” in Free Software refers to freedom, not price. FLOSS can and does coexist with commercial elements, and it is available for commercial use, development, and distribution. The GNU Project further elucidates:

{{quotation
|quote=Free software can be commercial

“Free software” does not mean “noncommercial.” On the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. 
|context=GNU Project: [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#:~:text=to%20that%20plan.-,Free%20software%20can%20be%20commercial,could%20not%20achieve%20its%20aims. What is Free Software?]
}}

Moreover, David A. Wheeler’s essay substantiates that Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is intrinsically commercial software, indicating that commercialization is not antithetical to the principles of open source and free software.

[https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is Commercial Software].

== Non-commercial Licenses ==
While all FLOSS approved licenses allow commercial use, there are licenses that permit free use and distribution but explicitly prohibit commercial exploitation. One such example is the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license. These licenses are typically chosen by developers who wish to restrict the commercial use of their creations while keeping them open and freely available for non-commercial purposes.

FLOSS license approval institutions never approved non-commercial licenses.

Non-commercial licenses are not FLOSS licenses.

== Commercial FLOSS ==
The Free, Libre and Open Source Software movements advocate for software freedom and openness, focusing on user rights and collaborative development. The notion that FLOSS should be devoid of monetary involvement is a misconception. In reality, FLOSS embraces the coexistence of software freedom and commercial utilization, allowing developers, distributors, and users to benefit mutually from both the ethical and economic aspects of software development.

== The Impact of Open Source and Proprietary Models on Business Revenue ==
Unreal Engine (UE) is renowned software used for developing video games and simulations, owned by Epic Games. It operates on a source-available model, enabling developers to access and read its entire source code. However, this accessibility comes with financial obligations. Developers profiting more than 1 million USD from software developed using Unreal Engine are mandated to pay a 5% royalty to Epic Games.

The notion that transitioning Unreal Engine to an Open Source model holds a 0% chance of income loss for Epic Games is overly optimistic and overlooks the inherent financial structures in place. Open Sourcing Unreal Engine would inevitably lead to a forfeiture of licensing fees, causing a direct impact on Epic Games' revenue streams from those fees.

Privacy and licensing agreement violations are predominantly non-concerns, considering that the main clientele of Unreal Engine are companies with a general adherence to legal and contractual obligations.

For instance, EA Sports WRC, a game by EA Games, leverages Unreal Engine for its development. A shift to an Open Source model would inherently grant EA Games, along with other developers, the liberty to abstain from paying licensing fees to Epic Games.
