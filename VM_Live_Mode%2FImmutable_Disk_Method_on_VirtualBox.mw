Step-by-step guide on implementing the Immutable Disk Method for Virtual Machine (VM) Live Mode in VirtualBox, focusing on secure, read-only VM configurations.

= Introduction =

For VirtualBox, there is also an alternate method to set the disks to read-only.
This option is the official method for setting VMs to read-only in VirtualBox. It will only work with the <code>grub-live</code> package, which is installed by default. <ref>
This option will not work with the <code>ro-mode-init</code> package.
</ref>

{{Testers-Only}}

This is not the preferred method. Hence this is for testers only. Kept only for reference in case other methods stop working.

VirtualBox documentation chapter [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html#hdimagewrites Special Image Write Modes] mentions <code>immutable images</code> but this might not be as good as <code>read-only images</code>.

= Procedure =

{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Make the [[VirtualBox]] disk immutable / read-only.

This step is crucial. Otherwise, contents might be recoverable from the host drive. <ref>
VirtualBox implements hard disk write protection differently. If an immutable virtual machine is booted, VirtualBox will always create a snapshot where data is written. After shutting down and booting the VM again (a soft reboot is inadequate), the old snapshot will be deleted and a new one created. Consequently, data will not persist in the VM, even if Live-mode is not selected. However, since the data is written to the hard disk of the host (instead of memory), it is easily recoverable. Therefore, selecting Live-mode is essential for safety. A snapshot file is still created, but it will not store any altered content from the VM.
</ref>

Follow these steps:

{{Box|text=
# Power off the VM.
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to: <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Virtual Media Manager</code>.
# Select the disk to write protect and release it.
# Click on <code>Modify</code> &rarr; <code>set it to Immutable</code>.
# In the VirtualBox main window, navigate to the settings of the VM.
# Under storage, select the top controller and add the existing hard disk there.
}}

'''2.''' Launch live-mode.

A second boot entry called "VM Live Mode-mode" will be visible. Select it and then press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.
