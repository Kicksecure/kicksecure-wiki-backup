There are no increased fingerprinting risks because [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1369309 VLC does not run Javascript]. <ref>However, unrestricted access to the large number of codecs, along with the gstreamer and ffmpeg frameworks can expose the system to remote attacks. The risk is greater than with Tor Browser because the latter attempts to restrict codecs to a particular subset.

{{Quotation
|quote=
iotop does for I/O usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It watches I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel and displays a table of current I/O usage by processes on the system. It is handy for answering the question "Why is the disk churning so much?".
|context=[https://packages.debian.org/iotop Debian iotop package]

=== Unsafe Paste Warning Popup ===
This is a demonstration of the <code>Warning: Unsafe Paste</code> feature of the Xfce Terminal Emulator. Other graphical terminal emulators might have similar features.

'''Figure:''' ''<code>Warning: Unsafe Paste</code> feature''

{{ContentImage|
[[File:warning-terminal.png|border]]
}}

{{box|text=
First a text editor is opened, then several arbitrary lines of text written, copied to clipboard and pasted into the terminal emulator.

'''1.''' Open a text editor.

{{Open File|filename=
some-file-name
}}

'''2.''' Write several lines of text.

Should be long lines. Should be multiple lines. The text is not important. Can be anything.

For example:

{{CodeSelect|code=
111111111111111111111111
222222222222222222222222
}}

'''3.''' Copy to clipboard.

Select all of the lines of text and right click, copy to clipboard.

'''4.''' Open a terminal.

{{Open a product ws terminal}}

'''5.''' Paste the text into the terminal.

'''6.''' The warning popup will appear.

<code>Warning: Unsafe Paste</code>

{{ContentImage|
[[File:warning-terminal.png|border]]
}}

'''7.''' Done.

The demonstration of the <code>Warning: Unsafe Paste</code> feature has been completed.

= Text Editor =
== Open File as Regular User ==
<code>mousepad</code> is installed by default.

Replace <code>/path/to/file</code> with the actual file name.

{{CodeSelect|code=
mousepad /path/to/file
}}

== Open File with Root Rights ==
Prefer <code>sudoedit</code> for better security. <ref>
https://forums.whonix.org/t/use-sudoedit-in-whonix-documentation-and-whonix-software/7599
</ref>

Note: Replace <code>/path/to/file</code> with the actual file name.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudoedit /path/to/file
}}

To use a different editor, replace <code>mousepad</code> with the name of the editor you wish to use.

{{CodeSelect|code=
SUDO_EDITOR=mousepad sudoedit /path/to/file
}}

== Office Suite ==

[https://www.libreoffice.org/ LibreOffice homepage] ([https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/libreoffice Debian package]) <ref>See also: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice LibreOffice in Wikipedia].</ref> is recommended.

== Printing and Scanning ==

See [[Printing and Scanning]].

== Publishing ==

[https://www.scribus.net/ Scribus homepage] ([https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/scribus Debian package]) is an open source desktop page layout accessible from the desktop menu (<code>Applications</code> → <code>Graphics</code>). It can be used for many tasks; from booklets design to newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation.

Scribus has sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents can be recovered with a simple text editor.

== scurl: SSL Command Line Downloader ==

To securely download files or webpages from the Internet on the command line, [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] is pre-installed in {{project_name_long}}. scurl should be preferred over wget, since the former enforces strong encryption and is less buggy. See also [[Secure Downloads]].

To invoke scurl to download a file, use the following syntax and replace the example URL with the file's location.

{{CodeSelect|code=
scurl https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/9.5/tor-browser-linux64-9.5_en-US.tar.xz
}}

This will download <code>tor-browser-linux64-9.5_en-US.tar.xz</code> to the current working directory.

Refer to the [[Secure_Downloads#Downloads_with_scurl_-_SSL_Command_Line_Downloader|scurl]] entry for further examples and a complete description of this tool.
