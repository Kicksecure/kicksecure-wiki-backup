|quote=Creating Qubes OS has been a great challenge, especially for such a small team as ours, but ultimately, I'm very glad with the final outcome – it really is a stable and reasonably secure desktop OS. In fact I cannot think of any more secure alternative...

I use the term “reasonably secure”, because when it comes to defensive security it's difficult to use definite statements (“secure”, “unbreakable”, etc), unless one can formally prove the whole design and implementation to be 100% secure.

|quote=In Qubes OS we took a practical approach and we have tried to focus on all those sensitive parts of the OS, and to make them reasonably secure. And, of course, in the first place, we tried to minimize the amount of those trusted parts, in which Qubes really stands out, I think.

So, we believe Qubes OS represents a reasonably secure OS. In fact I'm not aware of any other solution currently on the market that would come close when it comes to secure desktop environment. But then again, I'm biased, of course ;)

|quote=I wouldn't call Qubes OS “safe”, however, at least not at this stage. By “safe” I mean a product that is “safe to use”, which also implies “easy to use”, “not requiring special skills”, and thus harmless in the hands of an inexperienced user. I think that Apple iOS is a good example of such a “safe” OS – it automatically puts each application into its own sandbox, essentially not relaying on the user to make any security decisions. However, the isolation that each such sandbox provides is far from being secure, as various practical attacks have proven, and which is mostly a result of exposing too fat APIs to each sandbox, as I understand.

|quote=Finally, even though Qubes has been created by a reasonably skilled team of people, it should not be considered bug free.
