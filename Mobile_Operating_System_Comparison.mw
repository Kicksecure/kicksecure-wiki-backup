=== Google Android versus Android AOSP ===
Android AOSP (Android Open Source Project) is the Open-Source version of the Android operating system. It includes the core components of the operating system, such as the kernel, libraries, and basic applications. Android AOSP is freely available for anyone to download, modify, and use.

Google Android, on the other hand, is the version of Android that is developed and maintained by Google. It includes additional features and services developed by Google, such as Google Play, Google Maps, and Google Assistant. Google Android is the version of Android that is pre-installed on most Android devices and is the version that most people are familiar with.

Stock firmware from vendors such as Samsung is based on Google Android, but with additional customizations made by the vendor. These customizations can include changes to the user interface, additional features or apps, and modifications to the Android framework itself. Most if not all vendors install additional [[#Bloatware|bloatware]], that is software which is unwanted by the user and that often cannot be uninstalled.

Alternative ROMs, such as LineageOS, are based on Android AOSP but with additional modifications made by the ROM developer. These modifications can include additional features, performance optimizations, and changes to the user interface. Alternative ROMs are often popular among users who want more control over their device or who prefer a more stock Android experience without vendor customizations or bloatware.

=== Google Android ===
==== About Google Android ====
This applies to almost all users of Google Android. <ref>
Except to the few users using after market firmwares that resist flashing google play services.

The European Commission: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_18_4581 Antitrust: Commission fines Google €4.34 billion for illegal practices regarding Android mobile devices to strengthen dominance of Google's search engine]

==== Google Android SafetyNet ====
[[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Device_Attestation_such_as_SafetyNet|"SafetyNet"]]: Android rats out the user. It's informing applications if the user made modifications to the device that are unapproved by Google. The list of unapproved modifications currently includes the absence of Google Play Services (if when installed, lead to massive data harvesting), alternative operating systems and device rooting.

==== Google Android Espionage Data Harvesting ====
[[Mobile_Phone_Security#Espionage_Data_Harvesting|There is massive espionage data harvesting on Google Android.]] No surprise due to:

{{Google_Privacy}}

Android based operating systems based on Android AOSP that do not have Google Play Services (or possibly other Google apps) installed are exempt.

=== Android Generally ===
==== Android Anti-Features ====
There is a number of anti-features in both, Google Android as well as most (if not all) Android AOSP based operating systems.

* Apps can prevent the creation of screenshots.
* The owner of the device has no full read/write access to all the files on the device.
** App developers can can prevent their app's data from being backed up by setting <code>allowbackup=false</code>.
** Android prioritizes the wishes of the application developer over the wishes of the user. Android allows apps to set restrictions on how these apps can be used, even if those restrictions may be inconvenient or unwanted by the user.
** Users are prevented from accessing the device's host file (<code>/etc/hosts</code>), which can be used to block advertisements.
* Android can leak information to apps about whether the user is using location spoofing, which can be used to hide the user's actual location. <ref>
https://github.com/chriswoope/resign-android-image#locationismock-neutering <code>Location.isMock</code>]
</ref>
* There is no built-in boot menu that allows users to boot from USB or SD card for the purpose of data backup, troubleshooting, system modification, or experimentation with different operating systems.
* See also these [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#mobile_devices_restrictions|mobile devices restrictions]].

==== Android Developer Potential Conflict of Interest ====
Developers offering Android based operating systems for download have a potential [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Conflict_of_Interest|Conflict of Interest]]. If Android based projects would implement technical ways that most laymen users can use to gain root and/or to keep control over the software running on their devices, then the project's chances to be ever get a highly profitable hardware producer partnership would be severely diminished.

Browser based online banking login methods are often either being deprecated, not mobile friendly or never invented by many banks. For example,

* Revolut at time of writing offers only a mobile app. No browser based login at all. Neither for desktop nor mobile.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa M-Pesa], a popular mobile payment service. Looking at the [https://www.vodafone.com/about-vodafone/what-we-do/consumer-products-and-services/m-pesa#how-it-works M-Pesa website], it's a mobile app only. No mention of a web interface based login.
* Online web interfaces are available but painful to use since these are not responsive / mobile optimized. Most of these have been developed with desktop users in mind. For mobile users, banks provide banking apps. If using online banking web interfaces from a mobile phone is possible at all, the experience is often painful. [https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/banking-android-app-doesnt-work-because-device-is-rooted/11862/3 Quote]: <blockquote>You may find you can still use mobile banking via the web browser with your bank.

* Popular, modern mobile banking functionality such as scan to pay, contactless payments, fingerprint or face based login are unsupported when using browser based login.
* The large number of online discussions (such as on reddit) found on search engines (such as Google) on how to use banking apps on rooted mobile devices and/or devices using custom ROMs indicates that a large number of users would prefer to use the mobile app instead less comfortable, less feature-rich browser based login methods.
</ref> There's a list of [https://privsec.dev/posts/android/banking-applications-compatibility-with-grapheneos/ Banking Applications Compatibility with GrapheneOS] (that might also work for other forks of Android).
** In conclusion, the recommendation to simply not use such applications is impractical and counter the lived reality of many people.
* Full [[Verified Boot|verified boot]] which would be great if the key would be held by users and encouraged through a first start process or similar instead of held by the developer.

<blockquote>[...] supports applying modifications, such as having ADB root and being able to backup all applications, that violate the Android security model that GrapheneOS wishes to uphold, not because they make the device less secure for you, but because they follow your own wishes over providing guarantees to app developers that the OS will behave in a certain way.

Not having full arbitrary read/write access to the state of your own device state is generally considered unacceptable and the sign of a device that is not truly yours and completely under your control, but rather owned and controlled by an entity who dictates how your device should behave; unfortunately that's the way it is with upstream GrapheneOS and stock OS, but fortunately, you can remedy the situation with the --adb-root option.

No phone has a speaker yet that can be disabled but this is just as important as speakers can be turned into microphones. That is because a speaker is technically quite similar to microphones. See [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1611/1611.07350.pdf SPEAKE(a)R: Turn Speakers to Microphones for Fun and Profit].

Next best option is to have a phone that at least has a removable battery to make it's sometimes really powered off and not secretly spying.

== Quick Mentions ==
A quick mention on this wiki page means that only a minimal effort has been made reviewing the respective project. The accuracy of the wiki chapter might be low. Quick mentions are added because at first sight these seemed like noteworthy, interesting projects. A quick mention can be considered a watchlist that might be worth looking into further in the future. A more extensive review might be contributed at a later time.

== Bloatware ==
Bloatware is a term used to describe pre-installed software or applications on a device that are not essential to the device's core functionality or the user's needs. These applications may be installed by the device manufacturer, the operating system provider, or a third-party developer, and can take up valuable storage space, memory, and processing power on the device.

Bloatware is often considered undesirable by users because it can slow down the device, take up storage space that could be used for other purposes, and may even collect personal data or serve advertisements. However, some manufacturers and developers may include bloatware on devices as a way to generate additional revenue or promote their own services or products.

In summary, bloatware is unnecessary software that comes pre-installed on a device, and it can be a source of frustration for users who want to have more control over what is on their device and how it performs.
