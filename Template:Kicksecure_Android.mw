! Most iPhone / Android devices <ref name="most-mobile">
Most iPhone / Android phones that are sold by mobile carriers or manufacturers have locked bootloaders. These phones are often packaged with spyware installed by default, which cannot be removed. There may be rare exceptions to this rule, hence "most" and not "all". These exceptions are not the point which shall be made in this comparison. See the "Libre Android" column for what is theoretically possible.
</ref>
! "Libre Android" <ref>
There is no "Libre Android" at time of writing. It's only a concept to illustrate a point. There is no "perfect" Android distribution. GrapheneOS has verified boot but [https://archive.ph/2sYur root access is refused in default builds]. Replicant allows root access, but no references were found that Replicant makes use of verified boot yet. It's not relevant to pick any specific Android distribution for the sake of making the point "iPhone and Android Level Security for Linux Desktop Distributions" no specific Android distribution was chosen for this compassion. A "perfect" Android distribution checking all "green yes" is possible in theory. It doesn't exist due to policy decisions. (GrapheneOS vs root in default builds vs device selection / features.) There are no technical reasons for non-existence. See also this [[Mobile_Operating_System_Comparison|Overview of Mobile Projects, that focus on either/and/or security, privacy, anonymity, source-available, Freedom Software.]].

Computer (non-mobile) hardware is much more flexible. Storage devices can be removed from a computer, then added to another computer as a secondary disk. When booting from an installation assumed to be uncompromised (by [the same] malware), a search for malware can be performed on the other disk without executing any code, reducing risk of infection for the booted disk. This kind of procedure can be performed reasonably easily by most repair shops, and even non-technical people can do this without the need for soldering.

Again, this isn't just how Google does it; it's how everyone does it. It's Industry practice for location database vendors.</blockquote>

Quote [https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/06/1_billion_vulnerable_android_devices_which/ More than a billion hopelessly vulnerable Android gizmos in the wild that no longer receive security updates – research]. The operating system of these devices:

* Do not receive security upgrades from the vendor.
* Third parties (such as users or the modding community) cannot provide (security) upgrades either due to locked bootloaders, which cannot be unlocked due to vendor decision and due to unavailability of a security bug which could unlock the bootloader.
* Even if bootloaders can be unlocked there might not be an adequate operating system upgrades available from third parties, such as the modding community. Either due to unpopularity of the devices among modding developers and/or due to technical challenges.

Ability to upgrade (security fixes) devices; replace operating system; bootloader freedom vs bootloader non-freedom:

* iPhones and some Android devices have locked boot loaders that cannot be unlocked. This restricts user freedom and makes replacing the operating system impossible without a verified boot bypass exploit. In case the vendor deprecated security support for the device, the only choices users realistically have is to keep using an insecure device, or to buy a device which still has security support. Similarly, locked bootloaders also prevent gaining administrator (root) access.
* Some Android devices do allow unlocking the bootloader but not with custom verified boot keys, causing a decrease in security.
* Some Android devices (such as the Nexus or Pixel devices) support full verified boot with custom keys that can be used with alternative operating systems.

In conclusion, when using iPhone/Android devices that still receive security updates, the iPhone/Android approach provides strong protection against malware, meaning those platforms are impacted much less than Windows or Linux desktops. <ref name="exploitedapp"/> Despite the many downsides ([[Mobile_Phone_Security#Mobile_Devices_Backdoors_in_Most_Phones_Tablets_Etc|Mobile Devices Backdoors in Most Phones Tablets Etc]], [[Mobile_Phone_Security#Data_Harvesting_by_Most_Phones|Data Harvesting by Most Phones]], ...), the security model of popular mobile operating systems often affords better protection when attempting to prevent any malicious and unapproved party from establishing a foothold in their ecosystem. In the process, the user's and the security community's ability to audit and control what their devices are actually doing is severely diminished. Due to a [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Conflict_of_Interest|Conflict of Interest]] this comes at the expense of transferring power from the user to the developers, user freedom restrictions, [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Freedom_vs_Tyrant_Security|Tyrant Security]], [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#War_on_General_Purpose_Computing|War on General Purpose Computing]].<noinclude>
