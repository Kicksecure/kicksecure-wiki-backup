|description=Instructions to build {{project_name_long}} Virtual Machine Images from Source Code.
}} {{forkme}} {{title|title=
{{project_name_long}} VM Build Documentation
}}
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to <u>build {{project_name_long}}</u> VM (<u>V</u>irtual <u>M</u>achine) images for [[VirtualBox]] ({{Code2|.ova}}) or [[KVM]] ({{Code2|.qcow2}}) [[Trust#Builds_from_Source_Code_versus_Builds_including_Binary_Packages|<u>"from source code"</u>]].

For [[Qubes|{{q_project_name}}]], see [[Dev/Qubes#Build_{{q_project_name}}_Templates|{{q_project_name}} Build Documentation]].

Building from source code as security advantages (see [[Trust]]).

The goal of this build documentation is to be usable by as many users as possible. Therefore written as easy as possible with no prior knowledge of tools used required.

The high level summary is:

# Host preparation.
# Get {{project_name_long}} source code (which includes {{project_name_long}} build script).
# Run {{project_name_long}} build script.
# Done, build of {{project_name_long}} has been completed.

Advanced users that already know how to use <code>git</code> and how to perform digital software verification using OpenPGP (<code>gpg</code>) do not need to strictly follow this documentation. See footnote(s) for details. <ref>
For example, these instructions fetch only a specific git tag. If you know how to use git, you are of course free to <code>git clone</code> the whole repository and then use <code>git verify-tag</code>, <code>git verify-commit</code>, <code>git checkout --quiet</code> and <code>git</code> generally as per usual. The reason why more specific commands are being used on this page is to simplify the process for laymen, to make these instructions as fail-safe as possible.
</ref>

Due to digital software verification instructions and [[Software_Signature_Verification_Usability_Issues_and_Proposed_Solutions|Software Signature Verification Usability Issues]] these instructions might look more complicated then they actually are.

{{always_verify_signatures_reminder}}

Steps concerning digital software verification are pointed out as "This step is recommended for better security, but is not strictly required. (See [[Trust]].)"

When verifying digital software signatures, these instructions will be slightly more complicated but therefore even more secure.

# Host preparation.
# Get {{project_name_long}} source code (which includes {{project_name_long}} build script).
# Verify digital software signatures.
# Run {{project_name_long}} build script
# Done, build of {{project_name_long}} has been completed.

== Host Preparation Notices ==
* <u>operating system:</u> You need to build on '''Debian''' <u><code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code></u>, such as {{project_name_workstation_long}} <code>{{VersionShort}}</code> or a Debian <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> VM.
* <u>disk space:</u> You need ~ <code>30</code> GB free disk space.
* <u>RAM:</u> You need ~ <code>4</code> GB free RAM.
** Might actually work with a lot less RAM.
** Might actually work with less RAM if you have swap.
* <u>linux user account:</u> Do not build under user <code>root</code>. Login regular as user <code>user</code>. Do not use <code>sudo</code> to run <code>derivative-maker</code> because this is handled by the build script.
* <u>build place notice:</u> You cannot build on {{project_name_gateway_long}} (due to networking issues).
* <u>build logs:</u> Build logs: If using a GUI (graphical user interface) it is recommended to set your terminal (for example <code>xfce4-terminal</code>) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log and share it for support in case there are issues.
* <u>private files in source code warning:</u> Do not add private files to {{project_name_long}} source code folder! [...]
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Unless you know what you are doing. Technically, it would work. This is recommended against. Those files would get managed by the respective package. When you later update {{project_name_long}} debian packages, your files would get deleted by the package manager. Also adding private files to {{project_name_long}} source code folder, later contributing to {{project_name_long}} development and accidentally pushing the wrong git branch would be a disaster. Better add your private files to {{project_name_long}} after building {{project_name_long}}. Or add a custom build step adding your files, which then get copied from a folder outside of {{project_name_long}} source folder. See "Source Code Changes" in "Optional Build Configuration" below.
</div>
</div>
* <u>Exiting VMs name collision warning:</u> Make sure there aren't any VMs in VirtualBox (inside your build machine) already called {{project_name_gateway_long}} or {{project_name_workstation_long}}!
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Because the build script would fail, because it tries to create VMs either named {{project_name_gateway_long}} or {{project_name_workstation_long}}. Running the clean script between builds will prevent this error.
</div>
</div>
* <u>Parallel builds unsupported warning:</u> Do not try to build {{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}} at the same time!
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Building {{project_name_gateway_long}} and {{project_name_workstation_long}} at the same time is not supported due to limitations in the build script. In other words, do not try to run for example {{Code|~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor whonix-gateway -- --build --target virtualbox}} and {{Code|~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor whonix-workstation -- --build --target virtualbox}} at the same time. The build would probably fail.
</div>
</div>
* <u>CI warning:</u> Do not use images created inside Continuous Integration (CI) environments for anything besides testing!
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Usually you are not using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration CI] environments without knowing.

You can find out if you are running inside a CI environment by running.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo "$CI"

If it shows nothing, i.e.

Everything is fine.

Otherwise, if it were to show.

'''1.''' <u>build dependencies:</u>

{{Build_Dependencies}}
'''2.''' <u>Platform specific notices</u>:

* VirtualBox: Install VirtualBox on the build machine as per [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|recommended VirtualBox version]]. <ref>
Due to technical challenges, see [[Dev/VirtualBox#VirtualBox_Installation_Challenges|VirtualBox Installation Challenges]].
</ref>
* Other platforms: No special notice.

'''3.''' <u>sudo setup</u>:

Chose either Option A <u>or</u> Option B.

{{Tab|type=controller|id=options1}}
{{Tab|id=options1|addToClass=info-box active|title=Option A: passwordless sudo|content=
<u>Option A:</u> Set up passwordless sudo.

* Abstract task overview: Setup passwordless sudo for your Linux user account name.
* Detailed task overview: Setup sudo and add your current linux user account to the linux user group <code>sudo</code>. The following instructions use Linux user account name <code>user</code> as an example. If the user is using a different Linux user account name such as <code>myname</code> then the commands below have to be adjusted accordingly.
* Unspecific: Configuration of sudo is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].
* {{project name long}} specific: When building inside {{project name long}}, user <code>user</code> is already a member of group <code>sudo</code> by default. Therefore the following step "1." can be skipped.
* Detailed steps:

'''1.''' {{Sudo_Setup}}

'''2. ''' Configure user <code>user</code> to be able to use sudo without a password.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo '%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' {{!}} sudo EDITOR=tee visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/dist-build-sudo-passwordless >/dev/null
}}

'''3.''' Done.

The process of setting up passwordless sudo has been completed.
}}
{{Tab|id=options1|addToClass=info-box|title=Option B: long sudo timeout|content=
<u>Option B:</u> Set a longer sudo password timeout.

* Abstract task overview: Setup sudo with a longer timeout for your Linux user account name.
* Detailed task overview: Setup sudo and increase the sudo password timeout (four all Linux user accounts or all users). The following instructions use Linux user account name <code>user</code> as an example. If the user is using a different Linux user account name such as <code>myname</code> then the commands below have to be adjusted accordingly.
* Unspecific: Configuration of sudo is [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project name long}}]].
* {{project name long}} specific: When building inside {{project name long}}, user <code>user</code> is already a member of group <code>sudo</code> by default. Therefore the following step "1." can be skipped.
* Detailed steps:

'''1.''' {{Sudo_Setup}}

'''2. ''' Configure user <code>user</code> to be able to use sudo without a password.

{{CodeSelect|code=
echo 'Defaults timestamp_timeout=30' {{!}} sudo EDITOR=tee visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/dist-build-sudo-timeout >/dev/null

'''3.''' Done.

The process of setting up a longer sudo timeout has been completed.

= Choose Version =
{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project name long}} default admin password is: changeme]]
| text    = Version Numbers Choice Information

'''1.''' Common sense is required when choosing the right version number.

'''2.''' For example, the latest available git tag version number is not necessarily the most stable or suitable. 

'''3.''' Follow the [[Stay Tuned|{{project_name_long}} News Blog]] as it might contain information.

'''4.''' This documentation will be using <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> as an example. Replace <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> with the actual version chosen for the build.

'''5.''' Git tags by convention:

* have one of the following appendixes <code>stable</code>, <code>testers-only</code> or <code>developers-only</code> version.
* For example:
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code>
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-testers-only</code>
** <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code>
* all represent the very same source code. <ref>
{{CodeSelect|code=
git diff {{VersionNew}}-stable {{VersionNew}}-developers-only
}}
</ref>

'''6.''' If there is only git tag <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> available but a stable release announcement has been published, then there is no need to wait for the creation of <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> since it actually has already been blessed stable, would contain the identical source code anyhow but just have a different git tag name.
}}

{{mbox
| image   = [[File:Ambox_notice.png|40px|alt={{project name long}} default admin password is: changeme]]
| text    = Version Numbers Choice Instructions

'''1.''' Go to https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/news/ and look for the latest stable version number.

'''2.''' Compare with the stable version number mentioned in the wiki.

'''3.''' For example, if <code>{{VersionNew}}</code> has been announced in the forums and is available from the wiki, git tag <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> is avaialble but <code>{{VersionNew}}-stable</code> is not, then <code>{{VersionNew}}-developers-only</code> can be safely used.

= VM Creation =
<!--
EDITORS NOTE:
I am not sure it is a great idea to first tell builders how to build {{project_name_long}} and later how to clean up to prepare for another build. Running the cleanup steps before the creation steps may be unnecessary when running these steps for the first time, but doesn't hurt either. An important thing this does archive is creating fewer support requests and bug reports from people running these steps for the second time without remembering they have to clean up first. If you want to discuss this, please open a new discussion in the development forums.
-->
Mandatory. The following build targets are available.

* {{CodeSelect|code=--target virtualbox}} creates [[VirtualBox]] VMs.
* {{CodeSelect|code=--target qcow2}} creates <code>.qcow2</code> images for [[KVM]] and [[QEMU]].
* {{CodeSelect|code=--target raw}} creates <code>.raw</code> images.
* {{CodeSelect|code=--target root}} is for [[Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation|Physical Isolation Build Documentation]].
* {{CodeSelect|code=--target utm}}, preliminary support, tested on Mac M1 (<code>--arch <u>arm64</u></code>) with QEMU. <ref>
* [[MacOS#M1]]
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-on-mac-m1-arm/11310
</ref>
* {{CodeSelect|code=--target virtualbox}}, {{CodeSelect|code=--target qcow2}}, and {{CodeSelect|code=--target raw}} can be combined to build multiple images at once.

Mandatory. Choose a flavor.

* <code>--flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-<u>gateway</u>-<u>cli</u></code>
* <code>--flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-<u>gateway</u>-<u>xfce</u></code>
* <code>--flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-<u>workstation</u>-<u>cli</u></code>
* <code>--flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-<u>workstation</u>-<u>xfce</u></code>

Optional. Choose a target CPU architecture.

* <code>--arch <u>amd64</u></code> default, best tested.
* <code>--arch <u>i386</u></code> is [[untested]]. <ref>
[[Dev/64bit|32-bit or 64-bit?]]
</ref>
* <code>--arch <u>arm64</u></code>
* Potentially others. <ref>
* Build script parameter <code>--arch</code> results in setting the <code>BUILD_TARGET_ARCH</code> build variable. If you inspect ([[Dev/git#grep|<code>grep</code> tip]]) the build scripts for the variable name you can see other architectures might work but are untested.
* [[Dev/Porting|porting {{project_name_long}} to other platforms]]
</ref>

Optional. Enable [[Project-APT-Repository|{{project_name_long}} APT repository]] inside the images. <ref>
<code>--repo true</code> will set <code>export build_remote_repo_enable="true"</code> which results in setting

<pre>
DERIVATIVE_APT_REPOSITORY_OPTS="--enable --codename $derivative-maker_apt_stable_release"
export DERIVATIVE_APT_REPOSITORY_OPTS
</pre>

<code>derivative-maker_apt_stable_release</code> defaults to <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}</code> and could optionally through a [[Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Build_Configuration|build configuration]] set to <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-proposed-updates</code>, <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-testers</code> or <code>{{Stable project version based on Debian codename}}-developers</code>.
</ref> See [[Trust]]. This is done for official {{project_name_long}} [[Dev/Redistribution|redistributeable]] builds.

{{CodeSelect|code=
--repo true
}}

See also [[Build_Configuration|Optional Build Configuration]].

'''Note: These instructions use VirtualBox as an example, assume you have the {{project_name_long}} source code in your home folder (<code>~/derivative-maker</code>).'''

----

Delete any existing {{project_name_gateway_long}} virtual machine with the following command. '''Warning''': This will delete any virtual machine named {{project_name_gateway_long}} from VirtualBox installed on your build machine!

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-gateway-xfce --target virtualbox --clean
}}

Delete any existing {{project_name_workstation_long}} virtual machine with the following command. '''Warning''': This will delete any virtual machine named {{project_name_workstation_long}} from VirtualBox installed on your build machine!

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-workstation-xfce --target virtualbox --clean
}}

----

Build a {{project_name_gateway_long}} virtual machine image.

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-gateway-xfce --target virtualbox --build
}}

Build a {{project_name_workstation_long}} virtual machine image.

{{CodeSelect|code=
~/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker --flavor {{project_name_short_lowercase}}-workstation-xfce --target virtualbox --build
}}

While building, you might see a few [[Dev/Expected Build Warnings|Expected Build Warnings]].

= VM Build Result =

* VirtualBox: The newly created VMs can be seen in VirtualBox user interface and in the usual VirtualBox data folders.
* KVM, QEMU, raw images: The resulting <code>.qcow2</code> and/or <code>.raw</code> images can be found in <code>~/whonix_binary</code> folder.

Most users have completed the build process at this point, can start using {{project_name_long}} and skip the rest of this page.

= Unified Images =
Optional: Creation of ([https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-14-0-1-4-4-unified-ova-downloads-point-release/6996 unified]) <code>.ova</code> image(s) for {{project_name_long}} VirtualBox or <code>libvirt.xz</code> archives for {{project_name_long}} KVM. This might only be interesting if the goal is [[Dev/Redistribution|Redistribution]] of images to third parties such as the public.

There are two options.

* '''A''') Automated, a bit difficult (since it expects preexisting signing keys), using [[#Prepare Release|prepare_release]] script, <u>OR</u>
* '''B''') Manually.
** VirtualBox: Using the VirtualBox graphical or command line interface VM export feature could be used. <ref>
This is sane since important VM settings were already configured in https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/derivative-maker/blob/master/build-steps.d/2600_create-vbox-vm.

<code>prepare_release</code> VM export does nothing special/important for privately used builds.
</ref>
** KVM: Manually.

= Prepare Release =
[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-prepare-release prepare_release] is useful for:

* Creation of a [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-14-0-1-4-4-unified-ova-downloads-point-release/6996 unified] <code>.ova</code> image or <code>libvirt.xz</code> archive
* Creation of torrent files.
* Creation of hash sum files.
* Creation of digital software signatures.
** [[OpenPGP]] (gpg) signatures
** [[signify|signify]] signatures
* Adding the license agreement.
* Adding the disclaimer.
* [[Dev/Redistribution|Redistribution]].
* Example: {{CodeSelect|code=
sudo -E /home/user/derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/developer-meta-files/release/prepare_release --build --target virtualbox --flavor whonix-workstation-xfce
}}

For private builds, i.e. for builds which are not supposed to be redistributed to others, none of this is important. If any of this was important, it could also be done manually.
