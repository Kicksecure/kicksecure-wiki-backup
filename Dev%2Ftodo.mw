= TODO DEV =
== live mode systray in python ==
* cli + gui separate?

== browser choice - design ==
* wiki text only
* please review, improve [[Dev/browser-choice]]
* Fleshed out both internal and user-facing design quite a bit more, including creating UI mockups.
* please review wiki history (Patrick made changes)
* change to "always cards design" for installation method
* show installation command (even if hidden behind expand box) before execution (for transparency and so that advanced users can stay in the loop what is actually happening, less "magic")
** Aaron: Reviewed and added requested changes.
* boilerplate: https://github.com/Kicksecure/browser-choice
* Patrick:
** open-link-confirmation might need a better error message if no browser is installed yet
** Please point out that "Open Source browser only" and link to criteria. If too much text, perhaps a link to the criteria only.
** Please re-review changes.
** Maybe the tool could indicated somewhere how the browser is currently installed? - Like either "Firefox is not installed" or "Firefox is installed as Firefox Stable from Flathub"
* Aaron:
** Re-reviewed changes, made adjustments as appropriate and added requested adjustments from this task.
** open-link-confirmation can be dealt with once we start actually implementing code, however the code implementation task should have a note about it once we get to that point
* Patrick:
** How to handle user-sysmaint-split?
*** Are we going towards rootless appstore? [https://forums.whonix.org/t/user-sysmaint-split-role-based-boot-modes-persistent-user-live-user-persistent-sysmaint-system-maintenance/7708/59 No.]
** How to handle Qubes Template implementation?
*** If run inside Template based App Qube: point out that browser choice will be functional but browser will not persist due to Qubes default Template implementation.
*** If run inside Qubes Template: point out being run inside Qubes Template. Prepend required http_proxy variable as documented in [[Install_Software#Install_from_Flatpak|Install from Flatpak]]?
*** If run inside Qubes Standalone: point out being run inside Qubes Standalone.

== chat messenger research ==
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/recommended-private-chats-and-social-networks-for-whonix/21561/14
* For inspiration on the best messenger:
** https://privacyspreadsheet.com/messaging-apps
** https://www.securemessagingapps.com/#
** https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/
* review, improve https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Chat

== investigate Debian Rolling ==
* investigate why Debian Rolling initiative failed
** From initial research:
*** Lots of disagreement about how exactly to implement it, although https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/05/msg00275.html had a very large amount of positive feedback compared to other proposals
**** See also DEP-10 (https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep10/) which is somewhat orthogonal but related
*** Limited manpower, no one appears to have tried to actually do it
*** Need to cope with the activity occurring in Debian's unstable and testing repositories, which have some turbulence and can cause issues if one isn't careful
*** Likely worth trying to resurrect
* contact people involved previously, if that makes sense
* suggest prospective developers
* Started to write tooling for this: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/drk Very incomplete, nowhere near usable. Will keep developing this.

== ISO - btrfs versus grub-live bug - real fix ==
* todo
* report bug upstream
* systemd bug report: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/35540
* fix in dracut
** Cannot be fixed in dracut, dracut doesn't handle mounting /home. Instead opting to fix in grub-live.
** Might use kernel parameters using systemd features that may be available in trixie?
* since no response from systemd, needs to be fixed without systemd upstream support
* in case a reliable, solid implementation is not easy or not possible, this should either not be implemented or needs runtime sanity tests
* Current implementation plan:
** Create script (or augment existing script) that will look at all mounted filesystems, detect unsafe read/write mounts and report the system as either being fully persistent, semi-persistent, or fully live.
** Make livecheck recheck the system regularly (perhaps with an event-based mechanism if possible) and update messaging and the icon as necessary to indicate the system's state. Popups should be sent with notify-send to alert the user when something happens that affects the system's live state.
*** If no writable drives are mounted, show a green light. If writable, ''removable'' drives are mounted under /mnt or /media, show a yellow light. If non-removable drives of any kind are mounted, or if removable drives are mounted anywhere other than /mnt or /media, show a red light. NFS is considered a removable drive.
*** We should reimplement livecheck in Python + PyQt5. Use a system tray icon to indicate the live state, use a poll on /proc/self/mounts to detect when mounts change and rescan for possible danger.
** Create a systemd unit that will scan /etc/fstab on boot and mount overlayfs filesystems over the top of most persistent filesystems listed in /etc/fstab, with the exception of mounts under /media and /mnt and filesystems that should always be persistent (NFS specifically). This should run early during boot and block boot, and should not run unless the system is booted in live mode.
** Research how Tails live mode works in this regard and take inspiration from them if possible.
*** Won't boot unless it is booting from a USB medium with the removable media bit enabled
**** Idea - disks mounted that have the removable media bit set are probably OK to mark as yellow, use red when there are mounted "non-removable" disks which are more likely to be internal or external (semi-)permanent hard drives
*** Cannot mount non-removable drives without setting an administrator password on the initial setup screen and then providing that password when prompted
*** Removable media is automounted even without clicking on it in the file manager (?!)

== emergent shutdown discussion ==
* please read, comment if applicable
* https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unplugging-external-drive-doesnt-trigger-a-shutdown/994
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/panic-button-panic-shutdown-buskill-the-usb-kill-cord-for-your-laptop/13755
* Implemented, but may need further polish:
** security-misc: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/security-misc/tree/arraybolt3/emerg-shutdown
*** On my test system, this reliably causes the screen to black out and the OS to become inaccessible when I unplug the root filesystem device, but sometimes the power LED will remain lit and the fans will keep running. This happens about 50% of the time, the other 50% of the time a proper shutdown is done. Because of the shutdown method being used, I currently suspect this is the fault of my hardware and not of the implementation, but further testing will be needed to confirm that and documentation should indicate that users must test this feature thoroughly before relying on it in a security-sensitive situation.
*** This is supposed to work even if Kicksecure is burned to an optical disc and that disc is ejected, but I believe is currently will not work. I believe the kernel sends a different event for an ejected optical disc than for a removed USB drive.
*** Panic button support not yet implemented.
** helper-scripts: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/emerg-shutdown
*** The root device finding script could use more thorough testing and could be expanded to support more scenarios.
** user-sysmaint-split: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/user-sysmaint-split/tree/arraybolt3/emerg-shutdown

== emergency shutdown implementation ==
* when the boot USB drive is removed
* when panic key is pressed (most obviously probably the power button)

== live mode enhancements ==
* related to [[Grub-live#Comparison_between_grub-live_and_Tails|Comparison between grub-live and Tails]]
* research, compare with Tails
* Avoid writing to arbitrary (non-boot) host disks	
* Disables removable drives auto-mounting
* Disabled virtual machine shared folders

== permission-hardener - live bug ==
* got a bug report by e-mail

* random guess: Could there be issues with non-latin language settings?
* Why is it /usr/lib/live/mount/rootfs/filesystem?
* Could it be that the user booted into live mode?
* Maybe a case of low RAM where no further writes to RAM were possible?
* Booting into live mode and using APT should be supported as much as feasible.
* In case of insufficient information, could you please add debug code to provide more information in the future?
* Unsure if further information can be requested form the reporter, but I could try.
* Useful to add:

<pre>
test -w "${file_name_from_stat}"
</pre>

* permission hardener might not be the cause of this issue. However, ideally it would show a better error message pointing out the issue.
* Aaron: Cannot reproduce on ISO or in LIVE mode USER.
** The /usr/lib/live/mount path suggests that the issue is the result of attempting to distribution-morph a vanilla Debian Live session. This, IMO, is not something we should support, because:
*** All changes will be lost on reboot, meaning someone who uses this in production will be downloading a lot of Kicksecure packages from our infra every time they start the system.
*** We already offer a live Kicksecure ISO.
*** None of the kernel hardening options will be enabled, and they can't be enabled, because that would require a reboot which will discard everything.
*** And of course, permission-hardener doesn't expect anything under /usr to be read-only.
** Would suggest adding a warning to the distribution morphing documentation that a live Debian ISO session can't be morphed, and that one should download a live Kicksecure ISO if they need a Kicksecure-enhanced live system.
* Patrick: Done. Documented.
* Could you please add better error handling in this case?

== audio ==
=== audio generally ===
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/port-from-pulseaudio-to-pipewire-for-audio-support/16879/40
* please read, comment if something useful to share

=== VirtualBox Intel HD Audio and PipeWire Incompatibility / Audio broken after increasing ram to 5 GB / No sound after latest updates - PipeWire Bug? ===
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-intel-hd-audio-and-pipewire-incompatibility-audio-broken-after-increasing-ram-to-5-gb-no-sound-after-latest-updates-pipewire-bug/18211
* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965
* please investigate if doable with reasonable effort
* Tried switching between Pulseaudio and Pipewire on a booted VM, discovered I could "initialize" the speakers with Pulseaudio and then Pipewire would work thereafter
* Virtually certain this is an upstream bug, was able to reproduce with both Ubuntu 24.04 and Arch Linux.
* Suggest switching to AC97 audio (even Arch Linux defaults to this under Virtualbox).
* Need to investigate upstream code
* Could not get any meaningful hints from pipewire, wireplumber, and pipewire-pulse logs. Pulseaudio shows an "alsa woke us up to write new data to the device but there was actually nothing to write" error in its logs. At this point this is likely to be a bug in VirtualBox or the snd-hda-intel kernel driver.

== live-build - test lb config --dm-verity ==
* Does the ISO still function if build with <code>lb config --dm-verity</code>?
* Does it break apt-get install pkg-name? It might not break it due to overlayfs.
* Lacks live-build support when used with dracut:
** <code>lb config</code> won't even run if you try to enable verity and dracut at the same time, unless you override live-build by commenting that sanity check out
** The ISO won't build initially because the dm-verity building code is trying to find the live filesystem in the wrong location
** dracut isn't configured to include systemd-veritysetup-generator, needed for verifying the root FS in the first place
** No kernel command line options are added to the ISO for verity setup

== package refactoring - kicksecure-meta-packages vs qubes-whonix - #2 ==
* TODO: Reduce packages in https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/master/debian/control thanks to the improved Qubes support by kicksecure-meta-packages, if applicable.

** ./packages/kicksecure/dist-base-files/etc/machine-id
* but maybe needs to be moved back to anon-base-files when porting to Debian trixie? (hard to migrate within the same release codename)
* The machine-id files should not be shipped by a package. They are intended to be generated, not hardcoded, thus Debian's code is probably not going to cope well when a package ships these files. Case in point, live-build deleting them to avoid machines with duplicate IDs in the wild, when we want machines with duplicate IDs in the wild.
* Calamares is designed to write the machine-id files at instalation time. It has a dedicated module for this purpose. However, it does not permit specifying a hardcoded machine-id other than a literal "uninitialized" value or an empty file. So we will have to resort to using a shellprocess for Whonix-Host that will detect when Whonix is in use, and overwrite the machine-id files with a static machine-id. Calamares is the proper location to do this at IMO, since it's designed for this, systemd's docs suggest using the installer for this, and I fear we could run into problems trying to do this on first boot with a systemd unit.
** Patrick: Please implement.
** Patrick: Note, Whonix VMs are built using grml-debootstrap. While using a package to handle these files might be the wrong way. Whonix VMs still need these.

*** Please consider posting a feature request there for RPi GRUB support, if that is sensible. Draft:

<pre>
add support for GRUB as bootloader for RPi
</pre>

<pre>
I've recently succeeded in converting an existing Debian Trixie RPi image to boot using GRUB on the RPi 4B and extensively documented how to do that. [1] I also posted about this on the debian-arm mailing list. [2]

Booting in this way has several substantial advantages over the current Raspberry Pi boot process:

* The kernel command line can be modified via /etc/default/grub and files under /etc/default/grub.d. Some software requires or benefits from such modifications and leverages this mechanism in GRUB to make non-invasive changes to the command line. With direct kernel boot, these changes are silently ignored, while with U-Boot + GRUB, they are correctly applied.
* In the event of a bad kernel update, users can easily boot into older kernels as they would on a typical desktop system.
* Recovering from a broken boot without a secondary system becomes much easier, as users can use the GRUB and U-Boot consoles to debug and manually boot the system.
* Multiboot installations on the Pi become possible.

Is this a feature for which you would welcome a merge request here, either as an option or even as the default?

Obviously, at this point, RPi GRUB support could only be added to Forky and later.

(I've also recently submitted a pull request to `grml-debootstrap` (a Debian bootable image builder tool) [3] [4] implementing "basic" RPi support.)

Pinged the Calamares devs to see if they could do that, after than I'll ping the Debian Qt/KDE team to get them to package it and that should release calamares into Trixie.
** 3.3.12 was uploaded but was slightly wonky, wasn't migrating, maintainer wasn't fixing the issue yet. Got a DD friend to sponsor an NMU to fix the problem, should hopefully migrate on December 22nd if all goes well. (Thanks to Simon Quigley for sponsorship!)

debsums: changed file /etc/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

* All of these are modified by live-build itself:
** <code>/usr/sbin/sources-media</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO apt repo when dracut is in use (the location is different when initramfs-tools is used). The need for this could potentially be removed by modifying the <code>sources-media</code> script to autodetect the correct location, though this requires upstream to be receptive to the idea.
*** Please discuss upstream. Since there is already some sort of dm-verity support in upstream live-build (scripts/build/binary_dm-verity), upstream might be receiptive.
**** Feature request filed: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1089618
** <code>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>, which has a note in it as follows: "This removes dbus machine id that cache that makes each system unique." This seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. My Kicksecure VMs appear to have machine IDs, but it's unclear how they're being generated originally, so it may be worth enabling the machineid module in our Calamares configuration to ensure that the machine ID is properly generated.
*** See also: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Identifiers_Design_Goals
*** TODO: Discuss.
**** Proposal for fixing this made.
** <code>/etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO squashfs containing the operating system. Again, the location is different when initramfs-tools is used. This is a "hardcoded" configuration file, there isn't a way to add autodetection logic here. It might be possible to make a pull request to Calamares that would allow it to skip squashfses that didn't exist?
*** Yes, please discuss upstream.
**** Feature request filed: https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2409
** <code>/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/1010-enable-cryptsetup.hook.chroot</code>, where it is used to enable cryptsetup in initramfs-tools. Assuming this isn't legacy configuration, this seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. Might be worth testing to see if this is still necessary though.
*** Yes, please.
**** Bug report made: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1089624
** <code>/etc/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>. Has a very similar note to the other machine ID deletion hook. Same concerns apply.
*** Proposal for fixing this made.

== live-build - grub.cfg GRUB configuration - loopback.cfg ==
* add https://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg compatibility (as as Debian Live ISO)
* Requires fixes in live-build and Dracut to make work:
** live-build is specifying the wrong kernel parameter for loopback booting when using dracut - it's using <code>findiso</code> when it should be using <code>iso-scan/filename</code>. A fix for this has been integrated into my fork of live-build. MR to upstream here: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/376
** dracut is failing to run <code>udevadm trigger</code> during its device scanning, so even when it finds the ISO and attaches it as a loopback device, it never finds it. Only appears to be a problem on Debian Bookworm, Trixie works just fine.
*** Task is on hold until we migrate to Trixie.
** (Side note: At least on QEMU, loopback mounts in GRUB fail with out-of-memory errors if the system uses UEFI. With BIOS it works fine. Not quite sure why this happens, very well may be an issue with QEMU's implementation of UEFI hardware or my usage thereof.)

= REVIEW PLEASE =
== umask bug - copy from user to sudo missing permission - others ==
* how to reproduce:

{{CodeSelect|code=
touch a
sudo cp a /etc/a
ls -la /etc/a
}}

* expected result: readable by "others" ("public")
* actual result: unreadable by "others"
* this is probably happening because file "a" is created unreadable by "others". When copying, permissions are preserved.
* problematic in context of use cases such as:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo overwrite /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cwtch.im.list 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.cwtch.im-keyring.gpg] https://deb.cwtch.im/cwtch.im/ stable main'
}}

* Aaron:
** This is two separate issues. The issue as described with <code>cp</code> is not a bug and isn't fixable - <code>cp</code>'s behavior is to simply clone the file mode (permissions) of files it copies. This can be overridden using the <code>--no-preserve=mode</code> option.
** However, <code>overwrite</code> and other programs that use <code>append-shared</code> are indeed causing permission issues, they appear to be forcing the permissions of any file they touch to 0600. This is because we're creating a temporary file with the contents we want, then moving it into the location where the old file was. The permissions on the temporary file are 0600, so the final file ends up with the same (faulty) permissions.
*** Fix: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/append-perms

== live mode detection improvements ==
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/live-mode.sh
* Currently only based on grepping kernel command line.
* However, a different or the wrong initramfs generator might be in use. Or some other unexpected use case.
* Ideas on how to make live mode detection more reliable?
* Aaron: It might be possible to rely on the mount info for the root filesystem, which can be seen by running <code>LC_ALL='C' mount | grep ' on / '</code>. This returns a distinctly different string for each of persistent mode, live mode, and ISO live mode.
** PERSISTENT mode: /dev/mapper/luks-65abae64-dea9-4e54-b75f-0f545ed4a053 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
** LIVE mode (dracut): overlay on / type overlay (rw,noatime,lowerdir=/live/image,upperdir=/cow/rw,workdir=/cow/work,default_permissions)
** LIVE mode (initramfs-tools): overlay on / type overlay (rw,noatime,lowerdir=/run/live/rootfs/filesystem/,upperdir=/run/live/overlay/rw,workdir=/run/live/overlay/work,redirect_dir=on)
** ISO live mode: LiveOS_rootfs on / type overlay (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/run/rootfsbase,upperdir=/run/overlayfs,workdir=/run/ovlwork)
* Based on the above, we could say "if the string starts with <code>overlay on / type overlay</code>, then we're in GRUB live mode. If it starts with <code>LiveOS_rootfs</code>, we're in ISO live mode. Otherwise, we're in persistent mode.
* Notes:
** <code>LiveOS_rootfs</code> appears to be hardcoded throughout dracut, thus I believe this is a string we can rely on to be accurate.
** For Dracut, <code>overlay</code> for GRUB live mode is hardcoded in the Debian-specific <code>90overlay-root</code> module and thus can likely be relied upon, see <code>/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/90overlay-root/overlay-mount.sh</code>.
** For initramfs-tools, <code>overlay</code> for GRUB live mode is ''sorta'' hardcoded in live-boot, but not exactly, aufs is also supported and that might change the mount line. This may or may not be completely reliable.
* Patrick:
** Should we combine the existing kernel command line parameters based test with the new mount based test?
*** Aaron: IMO, no, the logic will become too complicated. Notably, if the mount info and kernel parameters say different things, we'll risk either telling the user that their changes will persist when they won't, or telling the user that their changes won't persist when they will. The mount info is likely to be more reliable and there's no need to check the kernel parameters too.
** Any way for to catch also the BTRFS home folder unexpected persistence bug (live mode indicator said "live" but /home folder was actually persistent bug)? Related: [[Dev/todo#ISO_-_btrfs_versus_grub-live_bug_-_real_fix|ISO - btrfs versus grub-live bug - real fix]]

*** Aaron: These look potentially useful, but I'm not experienced enough with the math being used here to really understand how this works. Given the final equations and a sufficiently powerful math library however, it might be possible to wrap the algorithms into a library which could then be made part of an application, where the user could define where to click, what area to move the mouse in, and the time period during which the mouse should move, then click a "play" button that would move the mouse and execute the clicks using these synthesized movements. It might even be possible to somehow integrate this into kloak, though I'm unsure if that would actually be advantageous or not.

* Waiting for planned fixes to land in PRs.
* Update 1:
** Please recheck.
** Notes:
*** square brackets aren't supported in systemd: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/35621
*** quote "The only issue is that VirtualBox only supports IPv6 if we switch to bridged interface, which exposes whonix gateway to the network. libvirt requires adding custom NAT rules for IPv6, which are only automatically managed for IPv4. If we want to add this, we'd need to add a static IP configuration and give the user instructions on how to add NAT rules on the host. So for now only Qubes will have direct support for IPv6 for outgoing transactions, without further instructions a user needs to do on the host."
* Can't get it working in VBox (even with bridged networking), libvirt (even with a custom network interface), or Qubes (apparent bug in Qubes R4.3 prevents me from making a new network-providing qube). See https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qubes-4-3-cannot-create-a-new-appvm-that-provides-network-to-other-qubes/30906/2.
* Update 2:

** https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-gw-network-conf/pull/1#discussion_r1903385335
** please direct questions, issues to Daniel (such as by adding these to https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/ipv6 or commenting on a pull request)
* Aaron: Left Daniel some feedback on things that didn't work. If not fixed in a week (so around April 4th), our plan is to merge as-is and fix bugs after.

== sysmaint-panel - distinct wallpapers for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ==
* sysmaint-panel shows a Kicksecure-like background image regardless of the underlying OS at the moment

* this is currently missing in testing by 3mdeb:
<pre>
page_poison
passing "P" to slub_debug
zeroing heap memory at free time (init_on_free=1)
</pre>
* maybe still time to add this before 3mdeb does ram-wipe testing?
* Aaron: Discussed in chat, we'd like 3mdeb to test the "plain" version without special kernel parameters set.
* Aaron: We should NOT pass "P" to slub_debug, see https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/18858

== live-build - use /etc/dracut.conf.d method to speed up the build ==
* similar to how it is implemented in 3500_install-packages
* Done, also fixed a problem with the Dracut initramfs inhibition code not being removed for VM builds.

* Possible to avoid disabling systemd-repart entirely inside Qubes? Because Qubes or users might start using it in theory.
* implement repart enabling similar to /usr/libexec/initializer-dist/chroot-scripts-post.d/75_setup-wizard-dist
* do not enable in Qubes
* Should be solved:
** dist-base-files: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/dist-base-files/tree/arraybolt3/repart
*** Note: I do not yet know for sure if the marker-vm file this implementation depends on will be present when dist-base-files is installed into the template. Asked in the Qubes OS Matrix room.
**** Patrick: Should not matter since my revision. Now a chroot-script handles this which runs after package installation. This is easy to see in the Kicksecure Qubes Template code. First packages are installed and only after the chroot-scripts are executed.
** initializer-dist: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/initializer-dist/tree/arraybolt3/repart

** Patrick: Please review my revision. #2
*** Aaron: Reviewed, looks good to me.

== user-sysmaint-split - unit fails on first sysmaint login ==
* the sysmaint account specific config routine is failing on the first sysmaint login, because PAM hasn't created the /home/sysmaint directory when this code attempts to run.
* move the code from sysmaint-boot to sysmaint-session and sysmaint-session-wayland
* Fixed, also refactored some duplicated code into a shared library: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/user-sysmaint-split/tree/arraybolt3/sysmaint-config
** Patrick: Merged.

== helper-scripts - strange symlinks issue ==
* due to a mixup with the append/append-once/overwrite rewrite, we now an append-once symlink that points to a file with the contents of a script as its name (this script was intended to replace the symlink, not become the target file name).
* Replace the symlinks with the intended scripts.
* Fixed: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/commit/370bd938dd54f9a53f95913ac174189d6cf57a03
** Patrick: Merged.

== research systemd-repart ==
* please research systemd-repart on how to automatically resize the image at first boot to use the full size of the storage medium
* interesting in context of RPi
* systemd-repart might be interesting in any case, not just for RPi images.
* Users are confused by [[sparse files]]. Our "normal" (non-RPi) images have a size of 100 GB. They can grow up to 100 GB. [[Grow_Virtual_Harddisk|Virtual Hard Disk Size Increase]] is a non-trivial process for users. Could systemd-repart help us to ship smaller apparent size images that can be more easily grown by users after boot?
* Researched, turns out making it so that the root partition is resized any time the disk is resized is not particularly difficult, and the easy way of doing it makes it so that the resize works properly ''any'' time it's resized, not just on the first time.
* Implemented resize support:
** initializer-dist: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/initializer-dist/tree/arraybolt3/repart
** dist-base-files: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/dist-base-files/tree/arraybolt3/repart
** derivative-maker: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/derivative-maker/commit/e3318ad701cca97d0defec5bf4cd73c78b06ebd7

== review and improve append-once ==
* [[append-once]]
** Aaron: Documentation updated to match the new implementation.
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/helper-scripts/blob/master/usr/bin/append-once
* Had some ideas for improving performance and reliability, shared in chat.
* use case: simplify writing to files while developing unrelated scripts (such as user-sysmaint-split)
* please rewrite in python as suggested
* the following tools should probably be separate tools
** these might however have shared code inside a library if that is sensible
* tool requirements:
** atomic writes
** error handling (unwriteable parent folder, unwriteable file)
* required functionality:
** only for already actually used use cases
* list of tools
** append (equivalent of: <code>echo test >> testfile</code>)
** append-once
** overwrite (equivalent of: <code>echo test | sponge testfile</code>)
* unneeded functionality for now:
** not adding a newline at the end (equivalent of: <code>printf "test" > testfile</code>)
** appending the the last line of the file (without starting a newline) (equivalent of: <code>printf test >> a</code>)
* Aaron: Implemented: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/file-utils
** All tools implemented as a multicall executable <code>append</code>, with <code>append-once</code> and <code>overwrite</code> symlinks.
*** Patrick: Merged.

== sysmaint-panel - support change full disk encryption fde password ==
* cases to consider: disk not encrypted
* Implemented:
** helper-scripts: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/pwchange
*** Patrick: Merged.
** sysmaint-panel: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/sysmaint-panel/commit/4cae9d07ec439da362ebd616f8f8367c35fa32da
*** Patrick: Merged.
** Note that the disk passphrase button is always visible, this is because the user might have external encrypted devices they wish to access or change the passphrases of.
** The crypt-pwchange utility DOES NOT offer the ability to add new passphrases, or delete existing ones. Those might be valuable features to add in the future.

== sysmaint-panel - add grub bootloader password support ==
* please review and improve
** /usr/sbin/grub-password-status-check
** /usr/sbin/grub-pwchange
** systemcheck check_grub_security
** [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#How_to_set_a_bootloader_password|How to set a bootloader password]]
** Aaron: Reviewed all of the above, sent comments in chat. Mostly looks good and appears to work on my end.
* add grub bootloader password support to sysmaint-panel
** do this on the host only, not inside VMs?
** Aaron: I don't think we need to restrict it like that - while bootloader passwords aren't theoretically useful in VMs, they might be practically useful against a low-skill adversary, and doing this would complicate development and make testing trickier.
*** Patrick: Agreed.
* Implemented: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/sysmaint-panel/commit/0271a053bfc3d1457ff11fc8889d1f088b8068c5
** Patrick: Merged.

== pstore disabling - please comment ==

* Looks like a good change to me, reviewed and requested a README change.
* Reviewed latest changes, things look good to me and the pstore disabling appears to work in my testing.

== Debian feature request - Debian's shim signed by Debian's key ==
* Debian's shim signed by Debian's key on top of Microsoft's key
* Sent feature request against shim.
* [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1102680 Offer a shim-signed variant signed by Debian's Secure Boot key]

== Dev/boot wiki page - review ==
* Patrick made stylistic changes but commands remain all the same. Please review [[Dev/boot]].
** Aaron: Reviewed, made minor changes. Looked very good for the most part.
* This is in preparation for the next task.
* Is command <code>grub-install --force-extra-removable</code> correct? (Unchanged.) It looks a bit short.
** Aaron: This is the right command. GRUB will automatically figure out where to install the bootloader since we're installing an EFI bootloader. This applies even when the system is not booted with UEFI.
* Note: While testing to make very sure this command was correct, I discovered USB boot isn't working right with U-Boot in this setup. Noted down the issue, this will probably take further research to resolve.
** Was resolved in task below.

== RPi GRUB - research USB Boot Support ==
* todo
* Discovered this is a problem with Bookworm, and Trixie is not affected. Documented the likely cause of the issue.

== RPi GRUB - Post TLDR Instructions on Debian RPi Salsa Feature Request ==
* rationale, potential issues (speculation): people not wanting to visit external websites / Kicksecure wiki / TLDR / not enough time to read lengthy instructions, planning to look later, then forgetting, stunned by complexity, ...
* todo: Please review, improve the TLDR version of [[Dev/boot#Booting_Debian_Trixie_with_GRUB_.2B_u-boot_on_Raspberry_Pi_4|Booting Debian Trixie with GRUB + u-boot on Raspberry Pi 4]]
* can be posted on https://salsa.debian.org/raspi-team/image-specs/-/issues/78, if appropriate
* Aaron: Posted. Did ''not'' add the short version to the Wiki since it felt awfully redundant and I wasn't sure I was supposed to do that.
** Patrick: Redundant instructions not required indeed. Task is complete.

== FYI - CodeSelect versus pipes ==
* note: (you might already know this.) CodeSelect cannot use pipes ("<code>|</code>"). These need to be excaped as <code><nowiki>{{!}}</nowiki></code>.

<pre>
{{CodeSelect|code=
xzcat raspi_4_trixie.img.xz {{!}} sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M
}}
</pre>

* This gets rendered as expected as:

{{CodeSelect|code=
xzcat raspi_4_trixie.img.xz {{!}} sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M
}}

* Just mentioning this to avoid a copy/paste issue (if copying from wiki source code) in the over next task.
* This task can be moved to archived.
* Aaron: Did not know this, will keep this in mind in future edits.

== stcatv - review ==

== unicode - sanitize suspicious characters in informative lines ==
* as discussed, avoid using <code>repr</code>
* might not need done after all, see chat

== grub-live - GRUB configuration not being regenerated when switching initramfs generator ==
* When installing initramfs-tools on Kicksecure, grub-live-dracut is swapped out for grub-live-initramfs-tools. This seems to work for the most part, however the GRUB configuration isn't regenerated, meaning live boot is broken until the next time the user (or some other part of the system) calls <code>update-grub</code>.
* This is because update-grub is only called when the master <code>grub-live</code> package is installed or removed. If one of <code>grub-live-dracut</code> or <code>grub-live-initramfs-tools</code> are installed or uninstalled, but the main <code>grub-live</code> package isn't, the GRUB configuration isn't regenerated. This is exactly what happens when switching initramfs engines usually.
* Fix: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/grub-live/tree/arraybolt3/initramfs-switch-fix

== updatecheck, setup-wizard-dist - don't assume sysmaint components are present ==
* Patrick working on this.
* [DONE] updatecheck assumes sysmaint-panel is preinstalled and instructs the user to use it, even if it's not present
* setup-wizard-dist does things similarly
** Aaron: Fixed: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/setup-wizard-dist/tree/arraybolt3/no-assume-sysmaint
*** Patrick: Merged.
* adjust both to only show sysmaint-related information if the corresponding components are installed
** Patrick did updatecheck, Aaron did setup-wizard-dist, so this is now solved.

== user-sysmaint-split - documentation improvements - #2 ==
* document Qubes boot modes on [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split]]
* document difference for user-sysmaint-split installation on Qubes R4.2 versus Qubes R4.3
* Read through the document, fixed some errors and omissions and added the requested docs.

== review - lightweight update notifications - #2 ==
* Implemented by Patrick. Please review.
* [DONE] consider custom languages. Needs <code>LC_ALL=C</code>?
* [DONE] notify leaprun failures
* [DONE] consider if update_package_count is not a number?
* [DONE] grep APT output for errors and notify?
* [DONE] systemcheck function <code>check_dpkg</code> or equivalent useful? If apt/dpkg is broken due to broken packages, that does not really break apt update?
** Not needed. DPKG is irrelevant.
* [DONE] use systemcheck function <code>check_package_manager_running</code> or equivalent?
** [DONE] if running for a "reasonable time", wait
** [DONE] if running "forever", notify that update check is broken
* [DONE] consider systems running for 12 or 18 hours etc:
** [DONE] Do notifications pile up more and more? Avoidable?
** [DONE] Can we clear prior notifications?
** [DONE] Can stale notifications be avoided? Can we clear "update check broken" notification once "updates available" notification came in? Can we clear "updates available" once user updated?
* Other error cases to notify?
* Documentation:
** [DONE] [[systemcheck]]: [[Systemcheck#Update_Notifications_by_updatecheck|Update Notifications by updatecheck]]
** [DONE] [[Dev/Automatic_Updates]]: [[Dev/Automatic_Updates#updatecheck|updatecheck]]
** [DONE] [[Operating System Software and Updates]]
** [DONE] non-Qubes vs Qubes

== user-sysmaint-split - sysmaint-panel - new features ==
* sysmaint-panel could be used to promote nice but lesser known functionality
* apt-get-reset
** should renamed to apt-get-reinstall?
** rationale: re-installation of a package (if other packages depend on it) while restoring configuration files back to package defaults is very difficult for users. Hence, apt-get-reset has been invented.

== RPi GRUB - Continue Research ==
* non-goal: RPi Secure Boot (due to issues documented in chapter [[Verified_Boot#Raspberry_Pi_RPi_Based]])
* non-goal: hiding of u-boot
* goal: complete RPi GRUB support for the purposes of
** being able to implement RPi GRUB support in grml-debootstrap - maybe - at a later time - depending on grml upstream feedback on RPi support
** being able to implement the functionality in derivative-maker (in case grml upstream rejects RPI GRUB support)
** todo items (updated by Patrick) on [[Dev/boot#Load_GRUB_with_u-boot]]
* document raspi-firmware versus clobbering config.txt (by /etc/kernel/postinst.d or similar) and consider how an implementation later could handle this (probably by using config-package-dev hide, dpkg divert or otherwise)
* Research done, additional notes added to Dev/boot. Likely ready to continue implementation when desirable.

== investigate Raspberry Pi GRUB compatibility ==
* to allow user-sysmaint-split and security enhancing kernel parameters to be used on the RPi
* use u-boot to load GRUB if possible, UEFI features of u-boot may be required for this
* grub-uboot may also be usable, though this works on 32-bit ARM only, but if it can load a 64-bit kernel, that might be OK
* or preferably https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/u-boot-rpi ?
* Got it to work with u-boot-rpi and grub-efi-arm64. Documented procedure and concepts at https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/boot#Booting_Debian_Trixie_with_GRUB_.2B_u-boot_on_Raspberry_Pi_4

* Patrick: Merged.

== user-sysmaint-split - lock screen command broken ==
* to debug, a terminal was started and then sysmaint-panel was started from the terminal emulator

<pre>

requestActivate() called for  QWidgetWindow(0x120a4600, name="BackgroundScreenWindow")  which has Qt::WindowDoesNotAcceptFocus set.
xscreensaver-command: no screensaver is running on display :0
</pre>

* Aaron: Known issue from last night, I apparently forgot to mark it in the task tracker though and only documented it in the progress reports. Fix in user-sysmaint-split: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/user-sysmaint-split/tree/arraybolt3/screenlock
*** Parick: Merged.
* Also found some other bugs while researching and fixing this:
** Warnings about missing passwords when disabling autologin were appearing at the wrong time in some situations. Fix in helper-scripts: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/commit/adaecfafcb6abae0bafb6f2d31436a661875bdfd
*** Parick: Merged.
** Software update notifications were appearing in a sysmaint session (which is not necessary or desirable). The notification would also advertise using sysmaint-panel even if it wasn't installed. Fixes in systemcheck: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/systemcheck/tree/arraybolt3/fix-updatecheck (Note: Includes some migration code, see chat for details)
** /etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list was not being generated on first boot if the user booted into PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT first. Fix in repository-dist: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/repository-dist/tree/arraybolt3/sysmaint
*** Parick: Merged.

== user-sysmaint-split - sysmaint-panel - check system status button - add delay ==
* systemcheck takes 2-3 seconds until user gets feedback. i pressed the button twice and then had a duplicate systemcheck.
* please disable the button for 2-5 seconds after it has been clicked.
* visible disable the button if the effort for that is reasonable
* perhaps a counter that counts down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1?
* perhaps generally should be the case for all buttons
* Implemented: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/sysmaint-panel/commit/7e39a7df817045ba3c4bc6f7a1f64e82bba71d92
** This is implemented for most buttons, except for Open Terminal, Reboot, Shut Down, and Install Software. The user experience when using those doesn't warrant a timeout lock and adding a timeout lock there would probably annoy the user.
** Visible timeout counter is present, implemented by adding a <code>(5)</code> at the end of each button label for the duration of the lock (where "5" will be replaced with the remaining seconds until the lock times out).
* Patrick: Merged.

== user-sysmaint-split - sysmaint-panel - install updates button confusing ==
* since it only runs apt dist-upgrade, users might miss out on upgrades because users might not know it's apt update followed by apt dist-upgrade
* Mostly resolved in https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/sysmaint-panel/commit/7ae6a0dcee5e15794dfdb78e9f804d0bf9394095, additional questions and details shared in chat
* Patrick: Merged.

== user-sysmaint-split - sysmaint-panel - output formatting issue ==
* shows:
<pre>
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/apt
update
</pre>
* that is confusing even for users that know that command. better: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/apt update
** Fixed: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/terminal-helper-output
* Patrick: Merged.
== user-sysmaint-split - sysmaint-panel - wrong error message if logging in as wrong user ==
* login with account "user" after booting into sysmaint mode
* ignore warnings by pam-info during login screen that already advice against logging in with account "user" (because the user might miss them in the future due to PAM bugs, pam-info bugs, other login managers)
* actual: sysmaint-panel shows error "boot into sysmaint"
* expected: sysmaint-panel shows error "please login as account "sysmaint"
* Fixed by implementing a new dialog: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/sysmaint-panel/commit/b782aa512689242d2a8066a1d7a36bc0ce40fc9b
* Patrick: Merged.

== user-admin-split - documentation improvements ==
* Qubes R4.2 vs R4.3
* Qubes uninstallation instructions (passwordless-root)
* Qubes boot modes
* user documentation
* developer documentation
* anything else missing
** Aaron: Don't see much missing, added requested points.

== autologinchange versus empty password ==
* issue:
** pwchange at time of writing does not notify if autologin is enabled
** autologinchange at time of writing does not notify if an empty password is being set
* the user might intend to secure their by using autologinchange and then be surprised that login without a password is still possible
* how could setting a password and autologinchange be more connected from a usability point of view?
* should one tool at the end of its execution recommend the other, if that seems applicable?
** applicable?
*** when disabling autologin, suggest to user to set a password, if password is currently empty.
*** when setting a password, suggest to user to disable autologin, if autologin is currently enabled.
** use colorful background to notify user of this potential discrepancy?
* or suggest or autorun systemcheck login security check only after such changes to make it obvious?
* Implemented: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/helper-scripts/tree/arraybolt3/pwchange-autologinchange-link
** Went with the strategy of having each tool warn if things are insecure when the user is doing hardening (i.e. warn about autologin when adding a password, or warn about empty password when disabling autologin)
** Patrick: Merged.

== lightweight update notifications ==
* Qubes vs non-Qubes:
** should not conflict with Qubes internal updater (multiple APT background processes blocking each other) - do this only inside Non-Qubes?
** on the other hand, systemcheck contains many tests that are useful inside Qubes as well
** Qubes developers do not wish the user to see a lot duplicate passive popups, active progress bars and active popups
*** Aaron: Qubes already shows upgrade notifications for VMs, so I would say this feature should not be added to Kicksecure or Whonix under Qubes OS. It's redundant and potentially conflicting.
* non-Qubes: GUI vs CLI?
** GUI: Implement this for the GUI version only?
** CLI: msgcollector supports writing to tty1 even for daemons (systemcheck) started in the background but this is probably confusing and disruptive. (Was default in the past.)
*** Aaron: Agreed, should be a GUI-only feature. CLI users can just run apt commands manually easily enough.
* as a stopgap until one day [[Dev/Automatic_Updates|Dev/Automatic Updates]] gets implemented
* re-use systemcheck for this? Could consider to re-enable autostart of systemcheck by default as it contains already lots of tests. "systemcheck --gui" currently shows:

<pre>

Please read https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Trust to understand the risk. If you want to change this, use: 
dom0 -> Start Menu -> Template: kicksecure-bookworm -> Derivative Repository

WARNING: Debian Package Update Check Result: apt-get reports that packages can be updated.

</pre>

* The first "INFO: Kicksecure APT Repository" might be too noisy and could easily be disabled in GUI output by default.
* git history contains /usr/libexec/systemcheckdaemon
** Aaron: systemcheck shows a lot of info about multiple components, much of which a user may skip over or be tempted to skip over. I would prefer implementing this in such a way that a typical desktop notification (such as what <code>notify-send</code> can produce) is shown to the user when there are updates.
** Patrick:
*** It's possible to run select functions only, for example: <code>systemcheck --verbose --function check_operating_system</code>.
*** Other functions might be useful as well such as <code>check_package_manager_running</code> and <code>check_dpkg</code>.
* Aaron: Implemented initial version of update notifications using a user-side daemon.

** password change instructions are currently on [[Post_Install_Advice|Post-installation Security Advice]]
** Aaron: Moved instructions from both locations to the Login page.
* also related: [[Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks|Protection against Physical Attacks]]
* please modify the wiki for better usability of this part. A wiki page is needed which explains at a glance, links users to more detailed sections.
** Aaron: Modified the Login, Post Install Advice, and Desktop wiki pages to move all login security related documentation into the Login page. Also added additional information about login security in general to the top of the login wiki page to provide good "at a glance" instructions. Also wrote a wiki page for the System Maintenance Panel itself so it could be referenced by other pages.
* systemcheck recommends sysmaint-panel - while not yet installed by default. Simplest solution would be to install it by default as it won't create issues for users not using user-sysmaint-split?
** Aaron: Sounds like a good idea to me. Implemented at https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/kicksecure-meta-packages/tree/arraybolt3/sysmaint-panel.
*** Patrick: Merged.
* systemcheck should point out that password / autologin inside VM is not "as important" (needs consideration when this is useful at all) as on the host? or skip login security check inside VMs?
** Aaron: I think this might be overcrowding the systemcheck output a bit. We currently don't express an opinion on whether the autologin or password protection status for each account is a problem in systemcheck itself, we only hint at it via colors. To me, this feels like the right approach since only the end user will know for sure what is secure for them. I think the login security check is still valuable in VMs though, as some users might have a legitimate reason to password-protect a VM (for instance, in a kiosk-like setup perhaps).
* documentation should point out that password / autologin inside VM is not "as important" (needs consideration when this is useful at all) as on the host? A lot users getting bothered with passwords and login prompts inside VMs if it does not benefit their threat model would be a usability degradation.
** Aaron: Agreed, this seems like a good place to put this kind of documentation. Added to the Login wiki page.

Description: usability enhancements inside virtual machines
 Sets environment variable `QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext` as workaround for
 "Automatic fallback to softwarecontext renderer".
 .
 It is not useful to open a screensaver or to power down the desktop for
 operating systems that are run inside VMs. There is no real display that could
 be saved and no real power that could be saved. From usability perspective it
 also is counter intuitive when looking at the VM window and only seeing a
 black screen. Therefore it makes sense to disable power savings in VMs.

* The Installed-Size of the package on the VM is listed as one size, but the Packages file in Kicksecure's remote repo lists a different Installed-Size. Thus even though the debs are identical, apt believes the packages are different and wants to update to the remote version of the package as a result. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/581291/why-apt-wants-to-upgrade-already-up-to-date-package. Why this is happening is unclear. Perhaps something is going wrong with using reprepro? See below.

* I did an OVA build in the background to see what Installed-Size it resulted in, but then accidentally deleted it, I can do redo the build and check it if desired.

== Qubes graphical-session.target missing bug ==
* Which source code file does enable systemd graphical-session.target target on Debian?
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9576
* Patrick: msgcollector now starts the systemd unit from /etc/xdg/autostart, that is good enough.

== add date and time detection to archive.today frontend ==
* This is necessary for the next task.
* If a link has been archived once in the past, but is severely outdated, we should probably request that archive.today rearchive it. This requires that we know when archive.today archived each page.
* (It might be worthwhile to detect when a link was added to the Wiki and use that as a deciding factor as to whether or not we should archive the link again. Might be doable by using the archive.today backups from Github.)
* We decided to not attempt re-archiving already archived content, thus this is no longer needed for now.

* Would require switching away from LightDM or enabling rootless X11 support in LightDM, thus moving to backlog.
