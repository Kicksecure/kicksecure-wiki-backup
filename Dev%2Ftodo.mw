== Add python3 dependency to mediawiki-shell package ==
* Lintian error during build of Kicksecure ISO from derivative-maker commit 8fa4ba76: "E: mediawiki-shell: python3-script-but-no-python3-dep /usr/bin/python3 (does not satisfy python3:any | python3-minimal:any) [usr/bin/mw-urlencode]"

== gpg sign all future git commits ==
* similar to https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/221

== kloak - add support for /dev/input/mice ==
* VM has no /dev/input/mouseX
* VM has only /dev/input/mice
* kloak ignores /dev/input/mice.
* (user reported using a Ubuntu 24.4 VM)
* kloak only uses /dev/input/eventX devices by design, these are provided by the evdev driver and seem like they should always exist
* Could not reproduce issue with QEMU using either Kicksecure or Lubuntu 24.04 - /dev/input/eventX devices for mouse always exist, as do individual /dev/input/mouse devices. Need to know what hypervisor was in use to test further

== kloak - update readme ==
* Please make sure compilation instructions are OK.
* Please check/fix readme.

== kloak - add Qubes support ==
* review to understand the history:
** https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1850
* [https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8534 enable qvm-service gui-agent-virtual-input-device for Whonix-Workstation App Qubes by default]

Comment in. Test. Fix if required. Report issues upstream to dracut.

If there are bookworm related issues, please test on trixie.

No backport required. The rationale of this task if to get away from Debian (fork) specific 90overlay-root to 90overlayfs one day. trixie is early enough since there are no major issues in the current implementation but might be in trixie if we don't port.

= WAITING ON =

= REVIEW PLEASE =

== seccomp debugging documentation ==
copy notes on seecmop debugging from https://github.com/Whonix/kloak/pull/1 to https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Seccomp

(so in the future when this is happening, we can link to the documentation so users get an idea how to debug and fix this)

just briefly similar to the pull request

== autostart systemd user unit xdg-desktop-portal ==
* [[Dev/audio#mod.rt:_Can.27t_find_org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop._Is_xdg-desktop-portal_running.3F|mod.rt: Can't find org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop. Is xdg-desktop-portal running?]]
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/desktop-config-dist
* note: is a systemd user (not system) unit
* using systemd preset

== kloak - add configuration option to disable rescue key ==
* user reported that some hotkeys aren't functional due to kloak rescue key.
* suggested solution, feature request: allow rescue key to be disabled thorough configuration
* a command line option + systemd unit drop-in configuration file?
* example systemd unit drop-in configuration: https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/75#issuecomment-2196543109

== kloak - document rescue key ==
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization#Kloak
* document: rescue key
* document: disable rescue key

== kloak - makefile fix ==
* Makefile should check if pkg-config exist because otherwise it fails with libevdev error?

== kloak - verbose log sharing ==
Documentation is currently stating:

<blockquote>Warning: Privacy implications of log sharing are unknown!</blockquote>

Might verbose log reveal the typing fingerprint of the user?

== kloak - mouse click obfuscation ==
* please confirm https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/51

== kloak - xrdp support ==
* is xrdp support conceivable?
* user reports: when using xrdp, only /dev/input/event0 is there, which does not contain real keystroke.
* This does not seem possible. xrdp is its own X server, logging keystrokes at the X server level is doable but intercepting them does not appear to be doable, see https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Progress_Reports?shownotice=1#Investigate_xrdp_support.

== kloak - testing ==
* test kloak
* improve documentation on testing https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization#Defense_Testing 
* maybe try to find additional tests (if needed) using perplexity.ai

== kloak development ==

* instead of this list, does it make more sense to review pull requests, issues and rewrite in python? (Works just fine in C, rewrite not planned at this time)
* strong compile time hardening flags (done)
* goal: perfect string parsing and error handling in case of corner issues, to not break input devices (keyboard, mice) (doesn't appear that much string parsing is done, currently not considered an issue)
* check pull requests, merge if sensible
** Add a header file to make future development easier - https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/pull/61 (done)
** Chatgpt3 https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/pull/65 (done)
** update readme  - https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/pull/70 (specific to vmonaco's version of Kloak, not Whonix's)
** add support for new devices attached after kloak starts (needs cleanup) - https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/pull/67 (done)
* code review with ChatGPT, claude.ai (done)
* use AddressSanitizer (aka ASan) if doable with reasonable effort and considered useful (done)
* port to C++ if considered useful (rewrite not planned at this time)
* other improvements to increase stability
** strncpy - https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/66 (done)
* fix compile time warnings if reasonable (probably already resolved by above) https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/35 (done)
* ARM support, only if doable with reasonable effort - https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak/issues/25 (done)
* fix time related keyboard stops working bug (done)
