== investigate Debian Rolling ==
* investigate why Debian Rolling initiative failed
** From initial research:
*** Lots of disagreement about how exactly to implement it, although https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/05/msg00275.html had a very large amount of positive feedback compared to other proposals
**** See also DEP-10 (https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep10/) which is somewhat orthogonal but related
*** Limited manpower, no one appears to have tried to actually do it
*** Need to cope with the activity occurring in Debian's unstable and testing repositories, which have some turbulence and can cause issues if one isn't careful
*** Likely worth trying to resurrect
* contact people involved previously, if that makes sense
* suggest prospective developers
* Started to write tooling for this: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/drk Very incomplete, nowhere near usable. Will keep developing this.

== calamares - make 3.3.12 available in Bookworm ==
* necessary to fix bugs related to the disk encryption user interface
* Sid and Trixie are still at 3.3.9, does maintainer need help packaging 3.3.12?
** Maintainer uploaded 3.3.12 to Sid, should migrate to Testing relatively soon.
** 3.3.11 was hung up on calamares-extensions 3.3.1, and while calamares-extensions 3.3.11 is technically available, a real release of it hasn't been made. Pinged the Calamares devs to see if they could do that, after than I'll ping the Debian Qt/KDE team to get them to package it and that should release calamares into Trixie.
* Backport 3.3.12 after it is available in Trixie

== review and test IPv6 support pull requests ==
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-ipv6-support/19893
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/ipv6
* please review for Non-Qubes-Whonix, Qubes-Whonix
* goal: merge as much as doable/possible without breaking networking
* enabling IPv6 support in Qubes-Whonix might only be possible during release upgrade to trixie based and orchestration with Qubes
* Waiting for planned fixes to land in PRs.
* Update 1:
** Please recheck.
** Notes:
*** square brackets aren't supported in systemd: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/35621
*** quote "The only issue is that VirtualBox only supports IPv6 if we switch to bridged interface, which exposes whonix gateway to the network. libvirt requires adding custom NAT rules for IPv6, which are only automatically managed for IPv4. If we want to add this, we'd need to add a static IP configuration and give the user instructions on how to add NAT rules on the host. So for now only Qubes will have direct support for IPv6 for outgoing transactions, without further instructions a user needs to do on the host."

== user-sysmaint-split and sysmaint-panel improvements ==
* rationale:
** A single command <code>dummy-dependency --yes --purge user-sysmaint-split</code> would be sufficient to go back to classic sudo setup. Uninstallation of <code>sysmaint-panel</code> would be unnecessary. Users could use <code>sysmaint-panel</code> even in classic sudo setup.
** sysmaint-panel should be fully independent from user-sysmaint-split. It could also be used in classic sudo mode, where user "user" has access to sudo/pkexec.
** easier to test sysmaint-panel
** Qubes compatible 

<pre>
   subprocess.Popen(["/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/terminal-wrapper",
                         "/bin/sh", "-c", "$SHELL"])
</pre>

* Is <code>/bin/sh</code> needed? <code>/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/terminal-wrapper "$SHELL"</code> works for me (manually tested).
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/sysmaint-panel/blob/master/etc/X11/Xsession.d/15_no_sysmaint_xfce
** remove xfce from the name, if applicable
** move to user-sysmaint-split
* sysmaint-panel Depends: usability-misc or is that a superfluous dependency?

<pre>
echo "[Desktop]
Session=sysmaint-session" \
   | sponge -- '/home/sysmaint/.dmrc'
</pre>

* needs to be run under user sysmaint to avoid permission issues
* needs Depends: safe-rm maybe?
* sysmaint-panel folder /usr/lib/systemd/system doesnâ€™t seem right for a gui package. Maybe...
** user-sysmaint-split-cli
** user-sysmaint-split-gui
** sysmaint-panel
*** would be a good split?
*** But actually we can get that down to 2 packages only. user-sysmaint-split + sysmaint-panel
* move https://github.com/Kicksecure/sysmaint-panel/blob/master/usr/libexec/sysmaint-panel/sysmaint-session
** to user-sysmaint-split
** How? By making sysmaint-panel a "plugin" or "extension".

<pre>
xfwm4 &
# Needed to prevent window ordering problems
sleep 1;
sysmaint-panel
</pre>

* could be changed to: if available, run sysmaint-panel. otherwise, just open a terminal. Pseudo code, untested:

<pre>
xfwm4 &
# Needed to prevent window ordering problems
sleep 1;
## NOTE: bashism
if command -v sysmaint-panel &>/dev/null ; then
  sysmaint-panel
else
  /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/terminal-wrapper "$SHELL"
fi
</pre>

* add a sysmaint-panel <code>/usr/share/desktop/sysmaint-panel.desktop</code> file
* check file <code>help-steps/pre</code> function <code>root_check</code>
** something similar is required for sysmaint-panel
** if sudo cannot be executed -> show an error message, explain to boot into sysmaint, show a link
* sysmaint-panel: honor signal sigterm

== document sysmaint warnings in wiki ==
* as discussed
* [[sysmaint]]

== review ARP related network settings ==
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/pull/279

== review USBGuard pull request ==
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/pull/166
* https://usb-ids.gowdy.us/read/UC/

== investigate dracut-config-generic ==
* VM images use dracut-config-generic because help-steps/variables has:

<pre>
[ -n "$BUILD_INITRAMFS_DRACUT" ] || BUILD_INITRAMFS_DRACUT="dracut dracut-live dracut-config-generic binutils dmsetup pigz"
</pre>

* ISO images do not have dracut-config-generic

<pre>
apt-file list dracut-config-generic 
dracut-config-generic: /etc/dracut.conf.d/20-generic-image.conf
cat /etc/dracut.conf.d/20-generic-image.conf
hostonly="no"
</pre>

* TODO: Would it be useful to have this package also on the ISO? Specifically since it would be useful if this package ends up on the installed system to always have a generic initial ramdisk as well as for feature/bug parity with VM images.
* Patrick: Seems actually already done as per:

<pre>
live-build/scripts/build/config:                        NEEDED_PACKAGES="live-config live-config-systemd systemd-sysv dracut-live dracut-config-generic dracut"
</pre>

== boot modes wiki page review ==
* [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split]] has been updated
* Please review.
* Ideas for chapter [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#Server_Support|Server Support]], and
* chapter [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#Todo|Todo]]?
* Related to upcoming tasks run0, sudoless, doas.
* I do not believe we should be implementing opt-out by having the user uninstall or delete things. Instead, let's provide a "Classic" option that the user can select at the boot menu, and provide guidance on modifying the default boot option.
** Patrick: The "classic" option would be confusing in the boot menu. Better to make user-sysmaint-split package uninstallable: dummy-dependency user-sysmaint-split
*** Aaron: Sounds good.
**** Patrick: Wiki page updated.
* Do we really want a recovery mode admin option? We specifically wanted to get rid of easy recovery mode access elsewhere.
** Patrick: Wiki was outdated on that. Recovery mode can stay disabled. Wiki has been updated to remove recovery mode.
* Server support can be handled by changing the default boot entry using <code>grub-set-default</code> most likely.
** Patrick: This would mean to boot the server always into admin mode? In that case, perhaps better to go back to "classic"?
*** Aaron: Yes, and that's included in the dummy-dependency user-sysmaint-split plan, so that's what we can do. Perhaps kicksecure-host-cli should use "classic" mode by default and kicksecure-host-xfce should use "user-sysmaint-split" by default?
**** Patrick: Yes. Wiki page updated.
* We need to choose what the default, topmost boot entry will become. Should that be "PERSISTENT mode User"?
** Patrick: Yes.
* We may want to prepend "Kicksecure" to all of these boot menu entries for clarity as to which operating system is which. For Whonix, we can prepend "Whonix" to the boot menu entries.
** Patrick: Yes.

== research verified boot and measured boot ==

* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Hardware_Wallet_Security
* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot
* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Measured_boot
* review, watch, improve, keep notes
* in preparation for consultation with firmware developer

Update #1:

Please review:

* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot#Boot_Block_versus_TPM

How does android implement relock bootloader with user custom keys?

* Android trusts the hardcoded android hardcoded bootloader?
* https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/238980/why-is-it-possible-to-re-lock-the-bootloader-after-installing-a-custom-rom-on-s
* [https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot/device-state#user-settable-root-of-trust Android: User-settable root of trust]
* [https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot/boot-flow Android: Boot Flow]
* [https://source.android.com/static/docs/security/images/verified-boot-flow.png Android: Figure 1. Verified boot flow.]
* rollback protection
* android hardware keystore (HSM)
* theft protection
* factory reset protection
* watch some videos on how Android is flashed, locked, unlocked, relocked

Concept improvements:

* stage 0 - super simple, write firmware from USB, no display graphical output support, truly read-only
* stage 1 - dasharo default firmware
* stage 2
* Verify distribution (Debian) kernel against distribution public key. Making use of EFI signatures but without using EFI.
* Mention why not using EFI.
* What if evil maid flashes using stage 0? -> Should break TOTP or similar mechanism.
* stage 1 preinstalled dasharo/heads firmware is required to match usability of user-settable root of trust, re-lock bootloader with user key supported Android phones such as Google Pixel.
* OS rollback protection
* factory reset protection
* Firmware rollback protection? if the user changes firmware keys on every update that might give us this "for free", but the key changes could be an expensive operation
* Document the need for a true ROM for firmware installation in the current design
* Create alternate design that involves no true ROM and vendor-provided firmware
* Document shortcomings with a vendor-provided, no-true-ROM solution
* See if adding some sort of secure, append-only storage is useful and work it in if so (hardware keystore hsm)
* Review Google's Android docs more and pull in anything that would make either design better
* Figure out how Heads avoids relay attacks with firmware verification, if it does
* usability: at least as good as Android phones, if not better
* no concept of OEM ROMs -> user chosen operating systems are the primary focus
* compatibility with standard Linux distributions, if possible
* windows compatibility? Probably not, unless there's an alternative enable EFI option in the firmware
* android: users can their own key but they can also use images by distributions
* theft protection
** offline
** online (remote locking)
* compare TOTP vs challenge response based (NitroKey). Or "nothing" (Android)?
* replay attacks
* relay attacks
* TPM MITM issue

* either send own hardware or TOFU
* maybe solvable if cloud vendor reveals TPM EK fingerprint beforehand?
* explain how others do it, compare: With Android, where companies are protecting themselves from the user, the same thing is true. The "owner" (manufacturer) can provision the system the way they want and the "attacker" (user) can't do anything about it ([[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Device_Attestation_such_as_SafetyNet|Device Attestation such as SafetyNet]])
* remote attestation is possible without verified boot? if known, please document, if unknown answer, please mention.
* custom kernel modules? re-invent MOK?
* boot guard -> dasharo (3MDEB) firmware -> heads (?) -> verify Debian's kernel against Debian's key?
* maybe the unchangeable root of trust would be well placed with boot guard, dasharo. the hopefully socially incorruptible organisation becoming the caretaker of taking care the most difficult parts.
* key management could be done at a "simpler level". at the level of heads (or similar).

== ISO - use BUILD_INITRAMFS_PKGS ==
* todo: could you please use $BUILD_INITRAMFS_PKGS (already existing variable) instead of hardcoding dracut as initramfs generator?

== Qubes umask ticket ==
* /etc/sudoers.d/umask
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/replace-sudo-with-doas/17482/22

== investigate sudoless ==
* https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/releases/tag/v4.2.0
* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/secureblue#sudoless
* Could we go sudoless by default?
* <code>sudo</code> no longer readable/executable by user <code>user</code> should be equally good or better as sudoless? sudo SUID issues would not be a problem if user <code>user</code> cannot execute sudo anymore? Only user admin would be allowed to execute <code>sudo</code>.
* In case going "sudoless" (actually similar to sudoless), it would not even be required to port to either run0 or doas?
* This would require finding solutions for existing sudoers.d exceptions. This is can be drafted on the [[Dev/sudo]] wiki page.
* Sudoless desktop-config-dist: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/desktop-config-dist/tree/arraybolt3/sudoless Ready for merge whenever desirable.
** Patrick: Was merged.
* '''WIP''' Persistent admin mode:
** Currently missing separate user account support!
** grub-live: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/grub-live/tree/arraybolt3/sudoless Adds an admin mode boot entry.
*** This may be the wrong package to put this in, do we want a new package for this?
**** Patrick: grub configuration looks good but requires dedicated package.
** security-misc: https://github.com/ArrayBolt3/security-misc/tree/arraybolt3/sudoless Actually implements the permissions changes for user and admin modes.
*** Patrick: Does not really? Does not belong into security-misc. Dedicated package required.

== investigate porting from sudo to doas ==
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/replace-sudo-with-doas/17482
* can our /etc/sudoers.d snippets be ported to doas? is doas powerful enough for our requirements based on our already existing /etc/sudoers.d snippets?
* could we have a system that no longer requires sudo or would we end up with a system that comes with both, sudo and doas? ("double" attack surface)
* use ReplaceText as a wiki search engine to find our current uses of sudo because these would need to be ported to doas
** https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:ReplaceText
** https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:ReplaceText
** search terms:
** <code>sudo</code>
** <code>lxsudo</code>
* Ensure sudoers.d config files used in Kicksecure and Whonix on Qubes OS can be ported to doas
* Did an audit of all uses of sudo in kickseure and whonix codebases, and how difficult they should be to port to doas. Results:  https://gist.github.com/ArrayBolt3/6699ec4c631fec28e1f4c0a2e657fcd7

== doas - send pull requests to Qubes ==
* [[Dev/todo#Qubes_doas_ticket|Qubes doas ticket]] might be unlikely to get rejected. But replies could take a while.
* Please send a pull requests. Since it is only 2 packages, 3 files the wasted effort if this gets rejected might be low enough?

* https://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-intel-hd-audio-and-pipewire-incompatibility-audio-broken-after-increasing-ram-to-5-gb-no-sound-after-latest-updates-pipewire-bug/18211
* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965
* please investigate if doable with reasonable effort
* Tried switching between Pulseaudio and Pipewire on a booted VM, discovered I could "initialize" the speakers with Pulseaudio and then Pipewire would work thereafter
* Virtually certain this is an upstream bug, was able to reproduce with both Ubuntu 24.04 and Arch Linux.
* Suggest switching to AC97 audio (even Arch Linux defaults to this under Virtualbox).
* Need to investigate upstream code
* Could not get any meaningful hints from pipewire, wireplumber, and pipewire-pulse logs. Pulseaudio shows an "alsa woke us up to write new data to the device but there was actually nothing to write" error in its logs. At this point this is likely to be a bug in VirtualBox or the snd-hda-intel kernel driver.

== live-build - test lb config --dm-verity ==
* Does the ISO still function if build with <code>lb config --dm-verity</code>?
* Does it break apt-get install pkg-name? It might not break it due to overlayfs.
* Lacks live-build support when used with dracut:
** <code>lb config</code> won't even run if you try to enable verity and dracut at the same time, unless you override live-build by commenting that sanity check out
** The ISO won't build initially because the dm-verity building code is trying to find the live filesystem in the wrong location
** dracut isn't configured to include systemd-veritysetup-generator, needed for verifying the root FS in the first place
** No kernel command line options are added to the ISO for verity setup

* nowadays implemented in dist-base-files
** ./packages/kicksecure/dist-base-files/var/lib/dbus/machine-id
** ./packages/kicksecure/dist-base-files/etc/machine-id
* but maybe needs to be moved back to anon-base-files when porting to Debian trixie? (hard to migrate within the same release codename)
* The machine-id files should not be shipped by a package. They are intended to be generated, not hardcoded, thus Debian's code is probably not going to cope well when a package ships these files. Case in point, live-build deleting them to avoid machines with duplicate IDs in the wild, when we want machines with duplicate IDs in the wild.
* Calamares is designed to write the machine-id files at instalation time. It has a dedicated module for this purpose. However, it does not permit specifying a hardcoded machine-id other than a literal "uninitialized" value or an empty file. So we will have to resort to using a shellprocess for Whonix-Host that will detect when Whonix is in use, and overwrite the machine-id files with a static machine-id. Calamares is the proper location to do this at IMO, since it's designed for this, systemd's docs suggest using the installer for this, and I fear we could run into problems trying to do this on first boot with a systemd unit.
** Patrick: Please implement.
** Patrick: Note, Whonix VMs are built using grml-debootstrap. While using a package to handle these files might be the wrong way. Whonix VMs still need these.

debsums: changed file /etc/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

* All of these are modified by live-build itself:
** <code>/usr/sbin/sources-media</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO apt repo when dracut is in use (the location is different when initramfs-tools is used). The need for this could potentially be removed by modifying the <code>sources-media</code> script to autodetect the correct location, though this requires upstream to be receptive to the idea.
*** Please discuss upstream. Since there is already some sort of dm-verity support in upstream live-build (scripts/build/binary_dm-verity), upstream might be receiptive.
**** Feature request filed: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1089618
** <code>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>, which has a note in it as follows: "This removes dbus machine id that cache that makes each system unique." This seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. My Kicksecure VMs appear to have machine IDs, but it's unclear how they're being generated originally, so it may be worth enabling the machineid module in our Calamares configuration to ensure that the machine ID is properly generated.
*** See also: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Identifiers_Design_Goals
*** TODO: Discuss.
**** Proposal for fixing this made.
** <code>/etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO squashfs containing the operating system. Again, the location is different when initramfs-tools is used. This is a "hardcoded" configuration file, there isn't a way to add autodetection logic here. It might be possible to make a pull request to Calamares that would allow it to skip squashfses that didn't exist?
*** Yes, please discuss upstream.
**** Feature request filed: https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2409
** <code>/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/1010-enable-cryptsetup.hook.chroot</code>, where it is used to enable cryptsetup in initramfs-tools. Assuming this isn't legacy configuration, this seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. Might be worth testing to see if this is still necessary though.
*** Yes, please.
**** Bug report made: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1089624
** <code>/etc/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>. Has a very similar note to the other machine ID deletion hook. Same concerns apply.

* Requires fixes in live-build and Dracut to make work:
** live-build is specifying the wrong kernel parameter for loopback booting when using dracut - it's using <code>findiso</code> when it should be using <code>iso-scan/filename</code>. A fix for this has been integrated into my fork of live-build. MR to upstream here: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/376
** dracut is failing to run <code>udevadm trigger</code> during its device scanning, so even when it finds the ISO and attaches it as a loopback device, it never finds it. Only appears to be a problem on Debian Bookworm, Trixie works just fine.
*** Task is on hold until we migrate to Trixie.
** (Side note: At least on QEMU, loopback mounts in GRUB fail with out-of-memory errors if the system uses UEFI. With BIOS it works fine. Not quite sure why this happens, very well may be an issue with QEMU's implementation of UEFI hardware or my usage thereof.)

== VirtualBox unattended installation pass-through ==
* how does that mechanism work?
* Short, highly simplified answer: for Debian, it finds a file on the ISO at <code>/.disk/info</code> and parses it for info. This file identifies Kicksecure ISOs as being Debian, and it's difficult to customize the contents in live-build. Needs either customization options added or downstream patches.
* Might be worth asking the VirtualBox people if they would consider adding a feature that would allow ISOs to "opt out" of autoinstall support, so that the user can't even try to use it in autoinstall mode.

* There appears to be no differences between an initramfs built with <code>dracut-config-rescue</code> installed and one without it. According to the Arch Wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dracut), the "rescue" module is supposed to provide tools such as <code>vi</code>, <code>ping</code>, etc., which are useful in the rescue shell, but I know from experience those are NOT present in Kicksecure's initramfs images. Thus I don't think it makes any difference either way. We could remove it in order to lighten our images, I don't expect this will cause any harm.

error: file `/boot/grub/i386-pc/efi_gop.mod' not found.
error: file `/boot/grub/i386-pc/efi_uga.mod' not found.
</pre>

* Debian bug for the core image? Got some search results:

<pre>
site:debian.org error: file `/boot/grub/i386-pc/efi_gop.mod' not found.
</pre>

* Maybe live-build fails to install a grub package?
* Side effect of no longer installing Debian-Installer?
** This is the result of fixing the missing font bug. If the unicode.pf2 font can be loaded, GRUB sets a static display resolution of 800x600 and attempts to load four different video drivers, two of which are the efi_gop.mod and efi_uga.mod drivers, and the other two of which are video_bochs and video_cirrus. If the font load fails, it allows the resolution to be automatically detected, and loads a driver called all_video. We're now ending up with the codepath involving the efi_gop and efi_uga drivers always hit since the font is now always found.
** Coincidentally, I noticed a bug where VMs with virtio graphics would not get a fancy graphical prompt, presumably because virtio is handled by the all_video driver and not the other four drivers.
** I think it would be best to just unconditionally use the all_video driver and autodetect resolution. The existing logic doesn't make sense to me, and because the font didn't even exist in the expected spot previously, we'd just be going back to the codepath we were hitting previously.
** After experimentation, this didn't work well at all. Went back to old GRUB config code from upstream with a note that it does not work. Fixing this will require more study to see how to get GRUB to not show cosmetic errors like this.

* Note: architecture specific. AMD64 vs PPC etc.
* These packages don't really cause any harm if installed on a BIOS machine, and both amd64 and arm64 UEFI machines may benefit from them. I don't see any reason why not to include them by default.
* All of these are being installed by default on both amd64 and arm64 builds, and appear to be pulled in either by Calamares or by GRUB. I think we should leave these up to live-build to choose whether to automatically install them or not, since if we end up supporting platforms that use firmware other than BIOS or UEFI in the future, these might not be relevant.

Description: usability enhancements inside virtual machines
 Sets environment variable `QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext` as workaround for
 "Automatic fallback to softwarecontext renderer".
 .
 It is not useful to open a screensaver or to power down the desktop for
 operating systems that are run inside VMs. There is no real display that could
 be saved and no real power that could be saved. From usability perspective it
 also is counter intuitive when looking at the VM window and only seeing a
 black screen. Therefore it makes sense to disable power savings in VMs.

* The Installed-Size of the package on the VM is listed as one size, but the Packages file in Kicksecure's remote repo lists a different Installed-Size. Thus even though the debs are identical, apt believes the packages are different and wants to update to the remote version of the package as a result. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/581291/why-apt-wants-to-upgrade-already-up-to-date-package. Why this is happening is unclear. Perhaps something is going wrong with using reprepro? See below.

# From https://deb.kicksecure.com/dists/bookworm/main/binary-amd64/Packages:
Package: vm-config-dist
...
Installed-Size: 135
...

# From /var/lib/dpkg/status from the linked OVA file:
Package: vm-config-dist
...
Installed-Size: 133
...
</pre>

* I did an OVA build in the background to see what Installed-Size it resulted in, but then accidentally deleted it, I can do redo the build and check it if desired.

* Low-priority, could be difficult to fix.

== Qubes graphical-session.target missing bug ==
* Which source code file does enable systemd graphical-session.target target on Debian?
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9576
* Patrick: msgcollector now starts the systemd unit from /etc/xdg/autostart, that is good enough.

== add date and time detection to archive.today frontend ==
* This is necessary for the next task.
* If a link has been archived once in the past, but is severely outdated, we should probably request that archive.today rearchive it. This requires that we know when archive.today archived each page.
* (It might be worthwhile to detect when a link was added to the Wiki and use that as a deciding factor as to whether or not we should archive the link again. Might be doable by using the archive.today backups from Github.)
* We decided to not attempt re-archiving already archived content, thus this is no longer needed for now.

* note: replace <code>botname</code> with actual name of bot

== rootless X11 ==
* only if doable with low effort such as just changing some configs (such as in lightdm config) or changing some installed packages
* Would require switching away from LightDM or enabling rootless X11 support in LightDM, thus moving to backlog.

== power9 RAM encryption research ==

== auto-detect, prompt for potential root devices in case the root= device is misconfigured or missing ==
* https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/2589
* if doable with reasonable effort please send a pull request to dracut-'''ng'''
* Pull request: https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/pull/694
* update: as discussed, low priority if effort is too high

== dracut add support for undeclared CDLABEL ==
as discussed

== live-build - Retry button in derivative-maker doesn't work ==
* low priority, move to backlog please
