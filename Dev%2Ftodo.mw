== investigate Debian Rolling ==
* investigate why Debian Rolling initiative failed
** From initial research:
*** Lots of disagreement about how exactly to implement it, although https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/05/msg00275.html had a very large amount of positive feedback compared to other proposals
**** See also DEP-10 (https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep10/) which is somewhat orthogonal but related
*** Limited manpower, no one appears to have tried to actually do it
*** Need to cope with the activity occurring in Debian's unstable and testing repositories, which have some turbulence and can cause issues if one isn't careful
*** Likely worth trying to resurrect
* contact people involved previously, if that makes sense
* suggest prospective developers

== calamares - make 3.3.12 available in Bookworm ==
* necessary to fix bugs related to the disk encryption user interface
* Sid and Trixie are still at 3.3.9, does maintainer need help packaging 3.3.12?
** Maintainer uploaded 3.3.12 to Sid, should migrate to Testing relatively soon.
** 3.3.11 was hung up on calamares-extensions 3.3.1, and while calamares-extensions 3.3.11 is technically available, a real release of it hasn't been made. Pinged the Calamares devs to see if they could do that, after than I'll ping the Debian Qt/KDE team to get them to package it and that should release calamares into Trixie.
* Backport 3.3.12 after it is available in Trixie

== grub-live debian control best practices ==
* please review, improve
* https://github.com/Kicksecure/grub-live/blob/master/debian/control
* Should grub-live <code>Depends: grub-live-dracut | grub-live-initramfs-tools</code>?

== ISO - fwupd ==
* Add fwupd
* fwupd-signed
* note: architecture specific?

== machine-id research ==

* in preparation for the next task
* please read prior discussions
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Identifiers_Design_Goals
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/revisit-handling-of-var-lib-dbus-machine-id/18827
* https://forums.whonix.org/t/anonymize-etc-machine-id/7721
* https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7100
* nowadays implemented in dist-base-files
** ./packages/kicksecure/dist-base-files/var/lib/dbus/machine-id
** ./packages/kicksecure/dist-base-files/etc/machine-id
* but maybe needs to be moved back to anon-base-files when porting to Debian trixie? (hard to migrate within the same release codename)

== ISO - changed files issues ==
(annoted)

<pre>
+ debsums --silent
debsums: changed file /usr/sbin/sources-media (from calamares-settings-debian package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: missing file /var/lib/dbus/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

<pre>
+ debsums --config --silent
debsums: changed file /etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf (from calamares-settings-debian package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: changed file /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook (from cryptsetup-initramfs package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: changed file /etc/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

* All of these are modified by live-build itself:
** <code>/usr/sbin/sources-media</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO apt repo when dracut is in use (the location is different when initramfs-tools is used). The need for this could potentially be removed by modifying the <code>sources-media</code> script to autodetect the correct location, though this requires upstream to be receptive to the idea.
*** Please discuss upstream. Since there is already some sort of dm-verity support in upstream live-build (scripts/build/binary_dm-verity), upstream might be receiptive.
** <code>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>, which has a note in it as follows: "This removes dbus machine id that cache that makes each system unique." This seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. My Kicksecure VMs appear to have machine IDs, but it's unclear how they're being generated originally, so it may be worth enabling the machineid module in our Calamares configuration to ensure that the machine ID is properly generated.
*** See also: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Identifiers_Design_Goals
*** TODO: Discuss.
** <code>/etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO squashfs containing the operating system. Again, the location is different when initramfs-tools is used. This is a "hardcoded" configuration file, there isn't a way to add autodetection logic here. It might be possible to make a pull request to Calamares that would allow it to skip squashfses that didn't exist?
*** Yes, please discuss upstream.
** <code>/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/1010-enable-cryptsetup.hook.chroot</code>, where it is used to enable cryptsetup in initramfs-tools. Assuming this isn't legacy configuration, this seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. Might be worth testing to see if this is still necessary though.
*** Yes, please.
** <code>/etc/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>. Has a very similar note to the other machine ID deletion hook. Same concerns apply.

* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965
* please investigate if doable with reasonable effort
* Tried switching between Pulseaudio and Pipewire on a booted VM, discovered I could "initialize" the speakers with Pulseaudio and then Pipewire would work thereafter
* Virtually certain this is an upstream bug, was able to reproduce with both Ubuntu 24.04 and Arch Linux.
* Suggest switching to AC97 audio (even Arch Linux defaults to this under Virtualbox).
* Need to investigate upstream code
* Could not get any meaningful hints from pipewire, wireplumber, and pipewire-pulse logs. Pulseaudio shows an "alsa woke us up to write new data to the device but there was actually nothing to write" error in its logs. At this point this is likely to be a bug in VirtualBox or the snd-hda-intel kernel driver.

== live-build - grub.cfg GRUB configuration - loopback.cfg ==
* add https://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg compatibility (as as Debian Live ISO)
* Requires fixes in live-build and Dracut to make work:
** live-build is specifying the wrong kernel parameter for loopback booting when using dracut - it's using <code>findiso</code> when it should be using <code>iso-scan/filename</code>. A fix for this has been integrated into my fork of live-build. MR to upstream here: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/376
** dracut is failing to run <code>udevadm trigger</code> during its device scanning, so even when it finds the ISO and attaches it as a loopback device, it never finds it. Only appears to be a problem on Debian Bookworm, Trixie works just fine.
*** Task is on hold until we migrate to Trixie.
** (Side note: At least on QEMU, loopback mounts in GRUB fail with out-of-memory errors if the system uses UEFI. With BIOS it works fine. Not quite sure why this happens, very well may be an issue with QEMU's implementation of UEFI hardware or my usage thereof.)

* mokutil is already installed.
* How about the others?
* Note: architecture specific. AMD64 vs PPC etc.
* These packages don't really cause any harm if installed on a BIOS machine, and both amd64 and arm64 UEFI machines may benefit from them. I don't see any reason why not to include them by default.
* All of these are being installed by default on both amd64 and arm64 builds, and appear to be pulled in either by Calamares or by GRUB. I think we should leave these up to live-build to choose whether to automatically install them or not, since if we end up supporting platforms that use firmware other than BIOS or UEFI in the future, these might not be relevant.

== multi architecture support ==
* the following code can be removed from build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine?
* required by grml-debootstrap for arm64 builds?

== vm-config-dist re-installs same version ==

* Why a freshly built ova image attempts to upgrade vm-config-dist, even though it is already the latest version?
* https://download.kicksecure.com/ova/17.2.7.8/
* please investigate

Description: usability enhancements inside virtual machines
 Sets environment variable `QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext` as workaround for
 "Automatic fallback to softwarecontext renderer".
 .
 It is not useful to open a screensaver or to power down the desktop for
 operating systems that are run inside VMs. There is no real display that could
 be saved and no real power that could be saved. From usability perspective it
 also is counter intuitive when looking at the VM window and only seeing a
 black screen. Therefore it makes sense to disable power savings in VMs.

* The Installed-Size of the package on the VM is listed as one size, but the Packages file in Kicksecure's remote repo lists a different Installed-Size. Thus even though the debs are identical, apt believes the packages are different and wants to update to the remote version of the package as a result. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/581291/why-apt-wants-to-upgrade-already-up-to-date-package. Why this is happening is unclear. Perhaps something is going wrong with using reprepro? See below.

<pre>
# From https://deb.kicksecure.com/dists/bookworm/main/binary-amd64/Packages:
Package: vm-config-dist
...
Installed-Size: 135
...

# From /var/lib/dpkg/status from the linked OVA file:
Package: vm-config-dist
...
Installed-Size: 133
...
</pre>

* I did an OVA build in the background to see what Installed-Size it resulted in, but then accidentally deleted it, I can do redo the build and check it if desired.

* Low-priority, could be difficult to fix.

== Qubes graphical-session.target missing bug ==
* Which source code file does enable systemd graphical-session.target target on Debian?
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9576
* Patrick: msgcollector now starts the systemd unit from /etc/xdg/autostart, that is good enough.

== add date and time detection to archive.today frontend ==
* This is necessary for the next task.
* If a link has been archived once in the past, but is severely outdated, we should probably request that archive.today rearchive it. This requires that we know when archive.today archived each page.
* (It might be worthwhile to detect when a link was added to the Wiki and use that as a deciding factor as to whether or not we should archive the link again. Might be doable by using the archive.today backups from Github.)
* We decided to not attempt re-archiving already archived content, thus this is no longer needed for now.

== mediawiki bot setup ==
* no wiki mass editing required for now
* will be required for mediawiki mass editing
* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:BotPasswords
* https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Special:BotPasswords/botname
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:BotPasswords
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Special:BotPasswords/botname
* note: replace <code>botname</code> with actual name of bot

== rootless X11 ==
* only if doable with low effort such as just changing some configs (such as in lightdm config) or changing some installed packages
* Would require switching away from LightDM or enabling rootless X11 support in LightDM, thus moving to backlog.

== power9 RAM encryption research ==
* todo

== auto-detect, prompt for potential root devices in case the root= device is misconfigured or missing ==
* https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/2589
* if doable with reasonable effort please send a pull request to dracut-'''ng'''
* Pull request: https://github.com/dracut-ng/dracut-ng/pull/694
* update: as discussed, low priority if effort is too high

== dracut add support for undeclared CDLABEL ==
as discussed

== live-build - Retry button in derivative-maker doesn't work ==
* low priority, move to backlog please
