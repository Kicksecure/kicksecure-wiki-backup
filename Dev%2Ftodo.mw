== live-build download of unverified debian packages ==
* investigate
* report bug upstream
* fix upstream, if applicable, possible
* live-build scripts/build/installer_debian-installer

<pre>
if [ "${LB_DEBIAN_INSTALLER_GUI}" = "true" ]
</pre>

<pre>
if $DOWNLOAD_GTK_INSTALLER; then
	mkdir -p "${DESTDIR_GI}"
	Download_file "${DESTDIR}"/"${VMLINUZ_GI}" ${URL}/${DI_REMOTE_BASE_GTK}/${DI_REMOTE_KERNEL}
	Download_file "${DESTDIR}"/"${INITRD_GI}" ${URL}/${DI_REMOTE_BASE_GTK}/initrd.gz

</pre>

* As a stopgap, should we set <code>LB_DEBIAN_INSTALLER_GUI=false</code>?

== calamares - make 3.3.12 available in Bookworm ==
* necessary to fix bugs related to the disk encryption user interface
* Sid and Trixie are still at 3.3.9, does maintainer need help packaging 3.3.12?
** Maintainer uploaded 3.3.12 to Sid, should migrate to Testing relatively soon.
** 3.3.11 was hung up on calamares-extensions 3.3.1, and while calamares-extensions 3.3.11 is technically available, a real release of it hasn't been made. Pinged the Calamares devs to see if they could do that, after than I'll ping the Debian Qt/KDE team to get them to package it and that should release calamares into Trixie.
* Backport 3.3.12 after it is available in Trixie

== ISO - changed files issues ==
(annoted)

<pre>
+ debsums --silent
debsums: changed file /usr/sbin/sources-media (from calamares-settings-debian package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: missing file /var/lib/dbus/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

<pre>
+ debsums --config --silent
debsums: changed file /etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf (from calamares-settings-debian package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: changed file /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook (from cryptsetup-initramfs package) - issue for future verified boot
debsums: changed file /etc/machine-id (from dist-base-files package) - issue for Whonix-Host, non-ideal for Kicksecure but not a blocker
</pre>

* All of these are modified by live-build itself:
** <code>/usr/sbin/sources-media</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO apt repo when dracut is in use (the location is different when initramfs-tools is used). The need for this could potentially be removed by modifying the <code>sources-media</code> script to autodetect the correct location, though this requires upstream to be receptive to the idea.
*** Please discuss upstream. Since there is already some sort of dm-verity support in upstream live-build (scripts/build/binary_dm-verity), upstream might be receiptive.
** <code>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>, which has a note in it as follows: "This removes dbus machine id that cache that makes each system unique." This seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. My Kicksecure VMs appear to have machine IDs, but it's unclear how they're being generated originally, so it may be worth enabling the machineid module in our Calamares configuration to ensure that the machine ID is properly generated.
*** See also: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Protocol-Leak-Protection_and_Fingerprinting-Protection#Identifiers_Design_Goals
*** TODO: Discuss.
** <code>/etc/calamares/modules/unpackfs.conf</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/5050-dracut.hook.chroot</code> so that it points to the proper location of the on-ISO squashfs containing the operating system. Again, the location is different when initramfs-tools is used. This is a "hardcoded" configuration file, there isn't a way to add autodetection logic here. It might be possible to make a pull request to Calamares that would allow it to skip squashfses that didn't exist?
*** Yes, please discuss upstream.
** <code>/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook</code> is modified by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/1010-enable-cryptsetup.hook.chroot</code>, where it is used to enable cryptsetup in initramfs-tools. Assuming this isn't legacy configuration, this seems important and I can't think of an obvious way to avoid needing to do this. Might be worth testing to see if this is still necessary though.
*** Yes, please.
** <code>/etc/machine-id</code> is deleted by <code>live-build/share/hooks/normal/8020-remove-dbus-machine-id.hook.chroot</code>. Has a very similar note to the other machine ID deletion hook. Same concerns apply.

* Suggest switching to AC97 audio (even Arch Linux defaults to this under Virtualbox).
* Need to investigate upstream code
* Could not get any meaningful hints from pipewire, wireplumber, and pipewire-pulse logs. Pulseaudio shows an "alsa woke us up to write new data to the device but there was actually nothing to write" error in its logs. At this point this is likely to be a bug in VirtualBox or the snd-hda-intel kernel driver.

== live-build - grub.cfg GRUB configuration - loopback.cfg ==
* add https://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg compatibility (as as Debian Live ISO)
* Requires fixes in live-build and Dracut to make work:
** live-build is specifying the wrong kernel parameter for loopback booting when using dracut - it's using <code>findiso</code> when it should be using <code>iso-scan/filename</code>. A fix for this has been integrated into my fork of live-build. MR to upstream here: https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build/-/merge_requests/376
** dracut is failing to run <code>udevadm trigger</code> during its device scanning, so even when it finds the ISO and attaches it as a loopback device, it never finds it. Only appears to be a problem on Debian Bookworm, Trixie works just fine.
*** Task is on hold until we migrate to Trixie.
** (Side note: At least on QEMU, loopback mounts in GRUB fail with out-of-memory errors if the system uses UEFI. With BIOS it works fine. Not quite sure why this happens, very well may be an issue with QEMU's implementation of UEFI hardware or my usage thereof.)

      packages_to_be_installed+=" mokutil "
      packages_to_be_installed+=" keyutils "
      packages_to_be_installed+=" efibootmgr "
</pre>

* mokutil is already installed.
* How about the others?
* Note: architecture specific. AMD64 vs PPC etc.
* These packages don't really cause any harm if installed on a BIOS machine, and both amd64 and arm64 UEFI machines may benefit from them. I don't see any reason why not to include them by default.
* All of these are being installed by default on both amd64 and arm64 builds, and appear to be pulled in either by Calamares or by GRUB. I think we should leave these up to live-build to choose whether to automatically install them or not, since if we end up supporting platforms that use firmware other than BIOS or UEFI in the future, these might not be relevant.

== multi architecture support ==
* the following code can be removed from build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine?
* required by grml-debootstrap for arm64 builds?
* please add support for other architectures to build-steps.d/2800_create-lb-iso
* just only mostly generic code. theoretical support only. no actual builds test needed for all architectures at this time.

- Either the build script does not know how to install the required grub '-bin'
  package for this architecture or the package is simply unavailable.
- Therefore ISO cross builds are unsupported. Patches welcome.
  Might be possible to implement this by running image-to-iso using qemu.

* If a link has been archived once in the past, but is severely outdated, we should probably request that archive.today rearchive it. This requires that we know when archive.today archived each page.
* (It might be worthwhile to detect when a link was added to the Wiki and use that as a deciding factor as to whether or not we should archive the link again. Might be doable by using the archive.today backups from Github.)
