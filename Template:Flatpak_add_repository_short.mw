Note:

* In most cases, this will not be required as the user will install from the most popular Flatpak repository, which is the Flathub repository.
* For the <code>flathub</code> Flatpak repository, this is not required in {{project_name_short}}, because it is enabled by default. For other repositories, see Follow the instructions to {{kicksecure_wiki

|text=Enable Flatpak Repository
}}.
