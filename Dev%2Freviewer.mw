Proposal: Base Distribution Developers = Derivative Developers
}}
{{#seo:
|description=This proposal outlines a strategy for increasing review bandwidth and development efficiency within Linux derivative projects by granting base distribution developers review and merge rights for derivative distributions.
}}
{{intro|
This proposal suggests a collaborative framework whereby developers from base Linux distributions, such as Debian or Fedora, are granted review and merge rights within derivative Linux projects like Kicksecure, Whonix, and Qubes. The aim is to leverage the established trust and vetting processes of larger distributions to expedite development, enhance security, and improve the implementation of bug fixes and feature requests in derivative distributions.

<u>Version: 1.0</u>
}}
= Issue =
* '''Low Review Bandwidth:''' The review bandwidth of many derivative Linux distributions (such as Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes) is low. This means there are sometimes complex, sometimes more source code and/or documentation contributions than the existing derivative core team can thoroughly review without jeopardizing the security of the operating system, merge, and maintain. This slows down development, growth, and implementation of bug fixes and feature requests.
* ''''Trust Decisions Difficulty:''' Establishing trust with people far from the internet is challenging. Physical meetups such as conferences are not a magical solution either. Deciding who gets review rights is difficult. This is probably why the named Linux derivatives have only a small team of people with review rights, and new reviewers are rarely added.

= Definitions =
* '''reviewer:''' An "reviewer" in this context is someone with the right to review and merge source code contributions (such as pull requests on GitHub) without necessarily requiring approval from the derivative distribution core team.
** '''Similar names in different contexts:''' In the case of Debian, these are called Debian Developer (DD) or maintainer, a different but similar concept. A DD can upload packages to Debian which they maintain, and any other package (NMU - non-maintainer upload), subject to Debian policy.
*** '''Upload rights:''' Are not necessarily required for reviewers.
* '''base distribution:''' Examples include Debian, Fedora.
* '''derivative distribution:''' Examples include Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes.

= Solution =
Any base distribution developer should be able to propose oneself for review, merge rights for the derivative distribution.

This may be limited to individuals who have made prior contributions.

This is an imperfect shortcut solution for the low bandwidth review queue by derivatives such as Kicksecure. What would be the "perfect" solution? See footnote [1].

Other alternatives. See footnote [2].

= Advantages =
* '''More speedy review of contributions:''' The review of pending contributions (pull requests) could be speed up because potentially there might more more reviewers.
* '''Simplified vetting process:''' The reviewer vetting process would be outsourced to larger Linux distribution(s) that have existing infrastructure to handle that. Want review rights? Simply show your credentials from eligible Linux base distributions.

= Eligible Linux Base Distributions =
* Debian.
** Debian is a natural choice because Debian Developers must be trusted as they have the capability to backdoor Debian and therefore any distribution based on it (Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes Debian Template) anyway.
* Could potentially be extended to include Fedora and other Linux base distributions pending the development of eligibility criteria.
* This should be discussed separately in case this proposal receives positive feedback. No need to engage in distribution wars if this concept is completely rejected.

= Why merge rights =
Why merge rights and not only review right?

Because then the responsibility would still be on the shoulders of the merger. The merge at the end is what gets recorded in git. With only review rights, not much would change. Even now, anyone can make a comment that can serve as a community review.

Without merge rights, this usefulness of this proposal would be severely limited.

= What this is not =
* Hard condition: This does not create a hard condition. It's an additional way. It does not curtail the rights of the existing decision-makers to grant review privileges to other people of their choice.
* Exclusion of existing members: This proposal does not suggest curtailing the rights of any existing members.

= Miscellaneous =
* Will it still be possible for the current decision makers to "sidestep" this proposal and grant review rights to any person, including those who are not base distribution developers? Yes.
* Can the project lead developer still refuse to grant review rights to any arbitrary number of base distribution developers? Yes.
* Can the project lead developer still revoke review rights? Yes.
* Can any member of the public still send pull requests as is possible prior to this proposal? Yes.
* Is this an absolute rule? No.
* Could there be a (short, cursory, or long) vetting before adding new reviewers? Yes.
* Did any base distribution developer suggest this? No, Patrick invented this idea without prior counselling with any base distribution developers.
* Did even any base distribution developers ever contribute to derivative distributions? Yes.
* How realistic is it that base distribution developers would contribute to derivative distributions? Unknown. But see above question. Worth trying. Effort is comparatively low. Maybe some will comment here.

= Footnotes =
* [1] The "perfect" solution would be for the derivative to develop and maintain a member mechanism similar to [https://nm.debian.org/ Debian New Member Process]. This would also require forking related policies such as [https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution Debian Constitution], [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianFreeSoftwareGuidelines Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)], [https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ Debian Policy], among an unknown number of other important policies and processes. However, this would be very hard, time-consuming, require reducing development activities, and a strong focus on the development of an organisational structure. This is presumably why that has not been done yet and is unlikely to happen soon.

= Improvements to this Proposal =
* Suggestions welcome.
* This is just a proposal. Instead of dismissing it, how can it be improved to be made suitable?
* The core team is obviously free to make any changes of their liking.
