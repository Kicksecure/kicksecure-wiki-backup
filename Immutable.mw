{{intro|
An "immutable" system is one where core parts of the system cannot be changed while it is running. In {{project_name_short}}, this means important folders like <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code> are read-only to protect the system from unwanted changes. Depending on the selected boot mode, personal files in <code>/home</code> may or may not be saved after shutdown. This page explains what immutability means in practice and how you can choose the right mode for your needs.

= Introduction =
The term "immutable" generally means that the running system cannot be altered. In technical terms, this is often achieved by using a [[read-only]] root file system. For further explanation and comparisons with other Linux distributions, see [[Dev/immutable]].

When booting into {{project_name_short}} [[Live_Mode|live mode]], the user session runs in a fully immutable (read-only) environment. System folders such as <code>/usr</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/boot</code>, and <code>/root</code> cannot be modified by the <code>user</code> account. While the <code>/home</code> folder is writable, all changes are stored temporarily in RAM and discarded after shutdown. In user session, the <code>user</code> account cannot escalate to administrative ("[[root]]") rights either.

In [[Persistent_Mode|persistent mode]], user session the system folders remain read-only for the <code>user</code> account, but changes made in the <code>/home</code> folder are saved and persist after reboot.

The [[Grub|GRUB]] boot menu allows you to choose the level of immutability. Want everything read-only? Select live mode. Need a persistent <code>/home</code> folder? Use persistent mode.

To make permanent changes to system folders like <code>/usr</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/var</code>, <code>/boot</code>, or <code>/root</code>, boot into persistent mode, sysmaint session. For more details, see [[sysmaint|user-sysmaint-split]].

If the user-sysmaint split does not suit your needs, consider using [[Unrestricted Admin Mode]].
