'''Note:'''

* systemcheck is a diagnostic tool that automates the display of diagnostic output from other diagnostic tools.
* {{project_name_long}} is not the cause of the issue. Don't kill the messenger.
* Spectre/Meltdown is a security vulnerability caused by flaws in hardware, specifically in CPUs (processors).
* This page explains the current state of affairs and how to protect against this security vulnerability.

{{quotation
|quote=A CPU is not just a dumb piece of hardware that can do basic calculations at high speed. Modern CPUs from Intel and AMD have many "software-like" features built-in. To name a few from a plethora of examples:
|context=[[Open-source_Hardware#Open_Source_BIOS_and_Firmware_Security_Impact|Open Source BIOS and Firmware Security Impact]]
}}

Security issues have been discovered in CPUs.

One recent example of a firmware vulnerability is the processor microcode update for modern chips to address [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3620 speculative] [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3646 execution flaws]. <ref>

* Apply [[#Processor Microcode Updates|Processor Microcode Updates]] on your host operating system. (Not required if using {{project_name_short}} as the host operating system, as this is already done by default.)
* Consider the following experimental instructions.

These experimental Spectre/Meltdown defenses relate to issues outlined in [[Firmware Security and Updates]]. Due to the significant performance penalty and unclear security benefits of applying these changes, it may not be worth the effort. The reason is that VirtualBox is still likely vulnerable, even after:

# A [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#Processor_Microcode_Updates|host microcode upgrade]].
# A host kernel upgrade.
# A VM kernel upgrade.
# A "not vulnerable" result from [[Firmware_Security_and_Updates#spectre-meltdown-checker|spectre-meltdown-checker]] run on the host.
# Installation of a recent VirtualBox version. <ref>
VirtualBox version <code>5.2.18</code> or above is required, as only that version includes Spectre/Meltdown defenses.
</ref>
# All Spectre/Meltdown-related VirtualBox settings are tuned for better security as documented below.

= Processor Microcode Updates =
Processor microcode is unfortunately non-freedom software, therefore only available in the Debian <code>nonfree</code> repository. <ref>
Relevant Debian packages for processor microcode: [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/intel-microcode Intel] and [https://packages.debian.org/{{Stable_project_version_based_on_Debian_codename}}/amd64-microcode amd64].
</ref> <ref>
Installing these updates by default would require enabling the Debian <code>nonfree</code> repository, which would logically make {{project_name_short}} images non-freedom.
</ref> {{project_name_short}} recommends to [[Avoid_nonfreedom_software|avoid non-freedom software]], but in this case, idealism would result in insecurity.

It is unnecessary to apply these updates in standard guest VMs, as they do not have the ability to alter the microcode. However, processor microcode updates <u>should</u> always be applied <u>on the host operating system</u> (for processors by Intel or AMD). <ref>
ARM is less affected than Intel architecture.

=== Microcode Package Check ===

If there is no output from the following checks, the package is not installed.

To check whether the microcode package is installed:

==== Debian-based ====
On the host, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
dpkg -l {{!}} grep microcode
}}

==== Qubes ====
In dom0, run:

{{CodeSelect|code=
dnf list {{!}} grep microcode
}}

The Qubes check should confirm that the <code>microcode_ctl.x86_64</code> package is already installed. <ref>
This package is installed by default in Qubes to automatically protect users against hardware threats.
</ref>

=== Install Microcode Package ===

To install the microcode packages: <ref>
Strictly speaking, installing the microcode package for your specific CPU (Intel or AMD) would suffice. However, {{project_name_long}} installs both packages by default. The other package will not have any effect but is useful to have installed if migrating to another CPU vendor.
</ref>

Choose either Intel or AMD:

[https://leaky.page leaky.page] -

Google's PoC is a Spectre V1 gadget that utilizes a JavaScript array speculatively accessed out of bounds. While the V1 gadget can be mitigated at the software level, Chrome's V8 team determined that mitigating other gadgets, such as those for Spectre Variant 4, is "simply infeasible in software." The code is designed for Intel Skylake CPUs but can potentially work on other architectures and browsers with minor modifications to the JavaScript. Google successfully ran this attack on Apple M1 ARM CPUs without any major changes. <ref>
