== Present Advertisements ==
=== Power Up Privacy ===
[https://powerupprivacy.com/ Power Up Privacy (PUP)] is mentioned on the [[Donors|{{project_name_short}} Donors Recognition]] page as well as is (will be) mentioned in the page footer. PUP does not request special sponsors privileges on feature inclusion, changes, etc. The donation was given expressly to help the project. PUP does not wish to influence the direction of the project.

* Amount of influence: none
* Non-monetary contributions: none
* Hiring influence: none
* Writing code: none
* Suggesting features: none

PUP is also supporting other related projects such as The Tor Project, and Monero. This list is non-exhaustive. See the PUP website for further information.

== Past Non-Monetary Advertisements ==

The past list of advertisements includes:

* <u>Fosshost</u>: <code>fosshost.org</code> was a non-profit organization that provided hosting services to the open source community. Fosshost provided a stage server for {{Kicksecure}}.
* <u>Jobble</u>: link exchange. It shows advertisements for {{project_name_short}} for related searches.
* <u>Search engines (YaCy | Qwant | ecosia | MetaGer | peekier)</u>: This is a voluntary listing by {{project_name_short}} and no discussions have occurred with any of these services. Also see [https://forums.whonix.org/t/local-browser-homepage-for-tor-browser-in-whonix/347/101 this forum post].
* <u>Evolution Host</u>: provided system administration advice for the <code>{{project_clearnet}}</code> website.

These advertisements did <u>not</u>:

* result in monetary compensation for the {{project_name_short}} project;
* influence the direction of {{project_name_short}} development; or
* lead to changes in {{project_name_short}} software or website choices (apart from the advertisement itself).

When? Several years ago.

== Past Monetary Advertisements ==
* Time: 2018
* Where: Actually on the Whonix website only. Not on the Kicksecure website, which did not exist at this time. Why mention this on the Kicksecure website? See footnote. <ref>
For simplicity, to be able to maintain this wiki page as {{kicksecure_wiki

* '''Separate Legal Entities:''' Sponsors and {{project_name_short}} will remain separate legal entities.
* '''Non-Influence Declaration:''' All sponsors, donors, and advertisers explicitly acknowledge that their contributions, whether monetary or non-monetary, do not entitle them to any form of influence over the {{project_name_short}} project's development, direction, or governance.

* '''Conflict of Interest:''' The project team is committed to maintaining independence and will take appropriate measures to ensure that sponsorships do not compromise the project's integrity.

* '''Sponsor Review Process:''' All sponsorships and advertisements undergo a thorough review process to ensure they align with the {{project_name_short}} project's values and do not conflict with the project's mission or legal obligations. Any sponsorships that could potentially compromise the project's objectives will be declined.

Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and make informed decisions when interacting with sponsored content.

The {{project_name_short}} project will not engage with sponsors or advertisers that operate in violation of these laws.

== Policy for Advertising on {{project_clearnet}} ==

* No targeted ads
* No tracking
* No spying
* No loading of web content from third party pages
* Just text and images
* Advertisements marked as advertisements
* No JavaScript or similar

== Affiliate Policy ==
This is only a consideration for a hypothetical future situation. Example: a VPN provider would offer sponsorship if {{project_name_short}} would provide a wizard for easily setting up VPN [trial] accounts.

* Non-default option
* Non-persuasive option
* Installing only Freedom Software by default (no non-Free, proprietary, nagware)
* Transparency about the partnership
* Maybe publishing scale of sponsorship (sum)
* Sticking to fair, nuanced, intellectually honest option about pros and cons
