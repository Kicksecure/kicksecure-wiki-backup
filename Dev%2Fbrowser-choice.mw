{{intro|
This page describes the concept, design, and implementation details of the browser selection interface. It includes user interface elements, plugin architecture, and eligibility criteria for browsers to be included in the selection tool.
}}

= example =
Historic, former implementation of Browser Choice by Microsoft.

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/BrowserChoice.gif
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserChoice.eu

<u>Note:</u> Browser Choice (by Kicksecure developers) is a complete reimplementation. No source code, images, or any other materials from Microsoft have been used. Browser Choice is fully independent, Open Source / Freedom Software.

= GUI elements =

* <u>Anytime:</u> The wizard can be started any time during the lifetime of Kicksecure. (Not only as a first boot wizard.)
* Structure as a wizard for ease-of-understanding.
** <u>Page 1:</u> Offer a selection of applications (currently web browsers are our primary target)
*** <u>intro text:</u>
**** <u>"Select Application":</u> Main prompt for user interaction.
**** <u>"web browsers" as a variable:</u> May be extended in the future to include options like "e-mail client". A tabbed interface can be used to allow the user to select what "class" of application they wish to choose from (browser, email, etc).
*** <u>alphabetic order:</u> Browsers are displayed in alphabetic order to avoid preferential treatment.
*** <u>header text:</u> Indicate number of applications available. Mention that they are listed in alphabetical order.
*** <u>logo 1:</u> Primary logo representing the browser.
*** <u>logo 2:</u> Possibly represents the installation method(s).
*** <u>browser name:</u> For example "Firefox".
**** <u>linked browser:</u> Link to browser homepage.
*** <u>subline:</u> name of the developer. For example: "by Mozilla"
*** <u>linked subline:</u> Link to for example "Mozilla".
*** <u>text:</u> Best omitted to reduce bias and maintenance.
*** <u>text / advantages / disadvantages:</u> Excluded to reduce maintenance effort and avoid potential legal issues. Instead, provide such comparisons in the wiki where updates and citations are easier.
*** <u>outro text:</u>
**** <u>"Further information"</u> section at the bottom of the interface.
**** <u>No user freedom restrictions</u>: [[Dev/browser-choice|browser-choice]] simplifies installation of eligible browsers according to the [[Dev/browser-choice#criteria_for_inclusion_into_browser_choice|criteria for inclusion into browser choice]]. There are [[Reasons_for_Freedom_Software#No_Intentional_User_Freedom_Restrictions|No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions]]. Users are free to install any browser, with or without the help of browser choice.
*** <u>user-sysmaint-split:</u>
**** <u>When run in user session:</u> Informs the user that they must boot into a sysmaint session to install applications. One can view available browsers, but cannot proceed further than page 1. This should appear as a separate popup before the wizard in order to avoid user confusion, then the first page of the wizard will be restricted as described.
**** <u>When run in sysmaint session:</u> Behaves as normal.
*** <u>Qubes OS:</u>
**** <u>When run in AppVM:</u> Informs the user that they may install a browser using this application, but it will be removed on reboot due to the AppVM self-reset feature in Qubes. Otherwise function normally. (Note that this popup shouldn't be displayed at all if booted into a user session with user-sysmaint-split installed, since browsers can't be installed at all in this configuration except maybe as a local-only Flatpak..
**** <u>When run in TemplateVM:</u> First page will feature a note in the text that a TemplateVM is in use. The <code>http_proxy</code> environment variable will be set as appropriate to allow network I/O.
**** <u>When run in StandaloneVM:</u> First page will feature a note in the text that a StandaloneVM is in use. Otherwise behaves as normal.
** <u>Page 2:</u> Offer available installation and uninstallation methods
*** <u>intro text:</u>
**** <u>"Choose Installation Options":</u> Main prompt for user interaction.
*** All installation methods listed in alphabetical order.
*** Installation method icons shown next to each available method with cards.
*** <u>"install, remove, purge":</u> Buttons for each installation method.
*** <u>Example: Firefox...</u>
**** <u>packages.debian.org package version</u>
**** <u>flatpak version</u> (may offer weaker sandboxing)
**** <u>Mozilla Debian repository version</u>
*** Show the user a confirmation screen before allowing them to proceed to the next page
** <u>Page 3:</u> Show (un)installation progress and logs
*** <u>intro text:</u>
**** <u>"modifying software":</u> Informs the user what is happening.
*** <u>Progress bar:</u> gives the user a rough idea of how close the process is to completion.
**** <u>Progress bar implementation difficulty:</u> Progress bar is optional. Some installation methods (APT, flatpak, tb-updater) might not output machine readable progress percentage numbers?
**** Skip progress bar in initial implementation, would too much plugin-specific code.
*** <u>Log view:</u> terminal-like window showing the user what is being done, useful for bug reports or to allow power users to diagnose issues themselves.
** <u>Page 4:</u> Offer launching a newly installed application
*** <u>intro text:</u>
**** <u>"software changes complete":</u> Informs the user what has happened.
*** <u>"click done to close the wizard":</u> button for the user to exit the wizard
*** If any new browser packages were installed, offer a <u>"launch now"</u> checkbox
*** If the user installed the same browser in multiple ways, offer a combo box for selecting the installation type to launch

= Browser Visibility =
* <u>Installed vs not installed:</u> Differentiate between already installed and not yet installed browsers.
* <u>No hidden browsers:</u> Gray out uninstallable browsers due to unavailability (many browsers are unavailable on ARM64 and other architectures) for transparency and avoidance of impression of bias.
* <u>Mark unavailable browsers:</u> "Unavailable on the <code>ARM64</code> architecture."

= No Randomized Order =
It has been considered to show browsers in a random order to avoid preferential treatment and decided against it. Reasons:

* <u>bad user experience:</u> Randomizing visible elements creates a sense of inconsistency for users who repeat the process. Even for first-time users, the perceived "random" order appears to be just a "normal static" order. The idea of randomization might appeal to lawyers or engineers, but most users would see it as excessive and a reduction in usability due to its inconsistency, especially when it's only intended to solve the simple issue of demonstrating neutrality.
* <u>automated testing issues:</u> Randomization would also introduce problems for automated (CI) testing.
* <u>no legal requirement:</u> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserChoice.eu BrowserChoice.eu] by Microsoft might have had a legal requirement or legal advice to randomize the order of browsers due to its dominant market position. However, that does not apply to {{project_name_short}}. While {{project_name_short}} aims to be as objective as possible, there is no legal requirement to do so. {{project_name_short}} is permitted to editorialize.

= Internal Design =

* <u>plugin based:</u>
** <u>Drop a file into <code>/usr/share/choice/browser</code>:</u> Enables modular addition of browsers.
*** <code>/usr/share/choice/browser/firefox.txt</code>
*** <code>/usr/share/choice/browser/chromium.txt</code>
** <u>Drop a file into <code>/usr/share/choice/e-mail</code> (probably not important):</u> May support e-mail clients in the future. May be expandable to cover any kind of application type for which multiple alternatives are available and choosing a default is difficult.
*** <code>/usr/share/choice/browser/thunderbird.txt</code>
*** <code>/usr/share/choice/browser/evolution.txt</code>
* Installation type icons and descriptions for common installation types are included by default (i.e. for "install from Debian repository", "install from Flatpak", "install from Snap Store", "install from Kicksecure repository" if applicable in the future, etc.
* Simple code for common installation types included by default, plugins can use these functions to simplify installation code. Should only be used when it's very simple to implement and likely to be widely duplicated (i.e. <code>apt install</code>, <code>flatpak install</code>, etc.).
* <u>logging:</u> All commands run by browser-choice and their outputs should be logged to a file to avoid undue blame for system issues on browser choice.

= plugin structure =

* <u>logo file name:</u> Image file representing the browser.
* <u>name:</u> Display name of the browser.
* <u>text:</u> Optional short description.
* <u>install script(s):</u> Script used to install the browser, one script per installation method.
* <u>uninstall script(s):</u> Script to remove the browser, one script per installation method.
* <u>purge script(s):</u> Script for complete removal including configuration files and user data, one script per installation method.
* <u>custom installation types:</u> For installation types unique to a particular browser (i.e. Mozilla repository, Brave repository), provide an icon and description for that installation type
* <u>capability:</u> Checks that the Kicksecure installation is capable of running the browser, and reports this information to the frontend which can hide or show the browser as a result. For instance, if a browser is only available on x86_64, it should be hidden on arm64 machines.
* <u>running plugin scripts:</u> Plugin installation, removal, and precheck/postcheck code is run inside a terminal-wrapper, which monitors the exit status of the script(s) that is/are run. The "final" exit status is written to a well-defined location (<code>$TMPDIR/browser-choice-plugin-exit-code</code>?) which <code>browser-choice</code> reads when the terminal-wrapper is closed. This is then used to determine whether the process succeeded or failed.

= Editorialized Installation Methods =

For example, Firefox can be installed using, and there are good arguments to make for.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ ''Installation Methods Comparison Example''

! Option !! Method !! Description
|-

| A || Debian packages.debian.org repository || ESR (Extended Support Release) - trusting binary builds by Debian
|-

| B || Mozilla repository || Rapid release - presumably as fast as possible directly from Mozilla
|-

| C || flatpak (system-wide installation) || Same as above; compatible with <code>/home</code> [[noexec]]
|-

| E || flatpak (per-user installation) || Same as above; no administrative ("[[root|<code>root</code>]]") rights required for installation; incompatible with <code>/home</code> [[noexec]]
|-

| F || snap || Might be superfluous due to other available options
|-

| G || tarball || Same as above
|-

|}

{{project_name_short}} developers will only implement major installation options. It is an explicit non-goal to offer all installation methods solely for the sake of completeness. Feature requests and contributions by upstream or the community might result in additional installation methods.

= apt-get =
* <code>apt-get-noninteractive</code>
* <u>require confirmation:</u> Do not use <code>apt-get</code> with parameter <code>--yes</code>.
* use terminal wrapper
* <u>rationale:</u>
** debconf questions
** configuration files questions
** broken system dependencies by the user getting worse (FrankenDebian)

= command line options =
* <u><code>--noupdate</code>:</u> Do not require operating system upgrades ("<code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>") already being installed.

= split GUI vs CLI =

* Python library with shared code used by plugins and frontends, includes features such as plugin enumeration and loading, getting paths to image files, getting descriptive text, getting documentation links, installing and removing software in common ways, getting installation status, etc.
* Shim that runs as root for handling installation and uninstallation when root privileges are needed, uses the library's code
* GUI version calls the library directly
* <u>should there be a (minimal) CLI version?</u>

= criteria for inclusion into browser choice =

* <u>Open Source:</u> Must be fully open-source.
* <u>availability of binary builds for Debian Linux Intel/AMD64:</u> Must have precompiled versions compatible with Debian on Intel/AMD64.
* <u>{{project_name_short}} compatibility:</u> Installation and execution must be functional on Kicksecure. It usually is but hypothetically some security settings by {{project_name_short}} might break a browser and upstream might not fix it.
* <u>stable:</u> Functionally stable. A stable version that has a 0.x version number or is called alpha or beta is not an exclusion criterion, as these version schemes and qualifiers are used inflationarily.
* <u>browser has a minimum of X users and/or market share or other noteworthiness:</u> Should be recognized or widely used, possibly included in major Linux distributions.
* <u>project exists for a minimum of X years:</u> Ensures sustainability and maturity.
* <u>must have X amount of developers:</u> Indicates active development and maintenance.
* <u>security:</u> Must not be majorly outdated or regularly lag behind in patches.
* <u>no obscenities:</u> Must not have offensive or inappropriate project names.
* <u>No malware:</u> No malware: must not be malware. This is difficult to define in the context of many browsers, which come with a lot of anti-features. So the bar for this is unfortunately pretty low. It must not be malware in the sense that it searches for files on the user's computer and uploads them to third parties.
* <u>Plugin availability:</u> A plugin for browser choice must be contributed and maintained by the vendor or community.
* <u>TBD:</u> Additional criteria may be defined.

* Note, if someone installs an unofficial plugin for an application such as (for instance) Vivaldi, the inclusion criteria notice will change to:

<pre>
| Unofficial plugins for Application Chooser have been installed. The   |
| applications above may not be open-source or may be otherwise         |
| non-compliant with the inclusion criteria listed at [Link]. Proceed   |
| with caution.                                                         |
</pre>

* Obviously, a plugin developer could work around this limitation rather trivially by specifying their plugin as official, there is nothing we can do or should do about that. Downstreams who want to offer non-FOSS browsers without showing a warning or lying to the user will have to fork browser-choice.

* When running under a user session when user-sysmaint-split is installed, the "continue" button is disabled. The following message is shown below the "solely for convenience" paragraph, and also appears as a popup:

<pre>
| user-sysmaint-split is installed, and you are currently booted into a |
| user session. You can view applications, but cannot install them. To  |
| install applications, please reboot into a sysmaint session. See      |

* When running under a Qubes AppVM, the following message is shown below the "solely for convenience" message, and also appears as a popup:

<pre>
| You are currently running Application Chooser inside a Qubes OS       |
