For more details about {{project_name_short}}, check [[About|{{project_name_short}}]] [[About|pages]].

Support tickets should be forwarded to the [https://forums.{{project_clearnet}}/c/kvm KVM subforum].

=== Build from Scratch ===

Advanced users are encouraged to [[Dev/Build_Documentation|build]] {{project_name_short}} images for high security assurance.

=== Decompress ===

Use {{Code2|tar}} to decompress the archive.

{{CodeSelect|code=
tar -xvf Kicksecure*.libvirt.xz
}}

Do not use {{Code2|unxz}}! Extract the images using {{Code2|tar}}.

== Importing {{project_name_short}} VM Template ==

The supplied XML files serve as a description for libvirt and define the properties of a {{project_name_short}} VM and the networking it should have.
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' {{project_name_short}} works with the network named ''default'' out of the box.

'''2.''' Import the {{project_name_short}} image.

{{CodeSelect|code=
virsh -c qemu:///system define Kicksecure*.xml
}}
}}

== Moving the {{project_name_short}} Image File ==

The XML files are configured to point to the default storage location of <code>/var/lib/libvirt/images</code>. The following steps move the images there so the machines can boot.

<u>Note:</u> Changing the default location may cause conflicts with SELinux, which will prevent the machines from booting.

It is recommended to move the image file instead of copying it.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo mv Kicksecure*.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Kicksecure.qcow2
}}
