ALSA, PulseAudio, PipeWire - Development Considerations

= PipeWire bug reports =

* [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/4263 Debian 12 on Virtualbox with Intel HD Audio will result in non-loading videos] - reports that AC97 works better than Intel HD.

* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/sound-is-cleaner-with-pipewire-from-backports-on-virtualbox/20344 Sound is cleaner with pipewire from backports on virtualbox]

= Debian bug reports =
* [https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1081965 Debian 12 in VirtualBox with Intel HD Audio, PipeWire, and 4 GB RAM causes videos to fail loading]

= QEMU / KVM bug reports =

* KVM forum: [https://forums.whonix.org/t/no-audio-with-spice-pipewire-halts-with-alsa-qemu-pipewire-unsupported/20341 No audio with SPICE + pipewire, halts with ALSA, Qemu pipewire unsupported]
** [https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2561 Sound doesnt work on debian guest + debian host using Pipewire]

= VirtualBox bug reports =

* [https://forums.whonix.org/t/choppy-sound-on-workstation-change-virtualbox-audio-settings-to-virtualbox-defaults-ac97-versus-intel-hd/17876 Choppy sound on Workstation - change VirtualBox Audio Settings to VirtualBox defaults - AC97 versus Intel HD] reports that Intel HD works better than AC97 (Blocker to be reliable option due to debian specific issue with Intel HD Audio).

* https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20634

= Kicksecure, security-misc bug reports =

* https://forums.whonix.org/t/kicksecure-17-2-2-0-unreleased-version-sound-driver-issue/20379
* [https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/issues/271 kernel module blacklist breaks VirtualBox audio devices ICH AC97 and maybe Intel HD]

= Impact of Host Operating System =
None. Unspecific to Windows host versus Linux host.

= Summary of PipeWire Sounds Issues inside VirtualBox =

Intel HD Audio:

* plain Debian/Kicksecure + 2GB RAM: functional
* plain Debian/Kicksecure + 4+GB RAM: broken
* ArchLinux: Working

AC97:

* ac97 + Debian/Kicksecure + any GB = functional

{{anchor|mod.rt: Can't find org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop. Is xdg-desktop-portal running}}

pipewire[1578]: mod.rt: Can't find org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop. Is xdg-desktop-portal running?
pipewire[1578]: mod.rt: found session bus but no portal
</pre>

* Non-Qubes Debian based issue only. Xfce issue only.
* Qubes Debian based does not have this issue.
* missing package: <code>xdg-desktop-portal</code> and probably also <code>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</code>
* problem is that Xfce does not have its own XDG desktop portal implementation. Therefore the <code>xdg-desktop-portal</code> systemd user unit does not autostart by default.
** manual workaround: {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
systemd --user start xdg-desktop-portal
}}
** <code>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</code> is a good choice as per https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/1199
** Xfce does not provide an XDG Desktop Portal by default.
*** [https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/-/issues/181 Please provide an xfce-portals.conf for xdg-desktop-portal >= 1.17])
*** [https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/-/issues/159 Does xdg-desktop-portal-xfce exist, or should it exist?]
** TODO research: how to implement this by default as a Linux distribution
*** in Debian <code>trixie</code> perhaps https://packages.debian.org/trixie/xdg-desktop-portal-xapp would work
