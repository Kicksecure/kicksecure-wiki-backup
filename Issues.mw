Section "Kicksecure â„¢ Developer OpenPGP Guidelines": (try to use the unclean URL version)

https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Trust&stable=0&shownotice=1&fromsection=Fingerprint_Trust#Kicksecure_%E2%84%A2_Developer_OpenPGP_Guidelines

Check "evil developer attack." URL it will give:(if you open it in new tab)

https://www.kicksecure.com/w/index.php?title=Trust&stable=0&shownotice=1&fromsection=Fingerprint_Trust#Evil_Developer_Attack

But if you use: (Clean URL)

https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Trust#Kicksecure_%E2%84%A2_Developer_OpenPGP_Guidelines

It will give: (If you open it in new tab)

https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Trust#Evil_Developer_Attack

So to solve this add main page name before the # like:(Making it giving clean URL in new tab)

[[Trust#Evil_Developer_Attack|evil developer attack]]

Instead of: (without Trust)

[[#Evil_Developer_Attack|evil developer attack]]
