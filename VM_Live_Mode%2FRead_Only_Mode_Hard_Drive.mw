Set virtual machine (VM) hard drives to read only. Prevent write access to VM drives.
}}
= Introduction =

It is possible to optionally set the virtual machine (VM) disks to read-only. This increases the security of [[Live Mode]] in the VM, because otherwise malware running as root in the VM could theoretically mount the image read-write and gain persistence in this way.

= Read-only Mode Configuration=

== Qubes ==

<code>grub-live</code> is currently [[unsupported]] on [[Qubes]], but may become available in the future. Refer to the following [https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-live-mode-amnesia-amnesic-non-persistent-anti-forensics/3894/31 forum discussion] for further information.

In Qubes R4, [[Qubes/DisposableVM|Qubes DisposableVMs]] are a suitable alternative.

== VirtualBox ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Version specific notice.

* '''A)''' On Debian bullseye based {{project name long}} <code>16</code>: This might still be functional.
* '''B)''' On Debian bookworm based {{project name long}} <code>17</code> (and above) / Newer VirtualBox versions:
** VirtualBox might no longer support <code>VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly</code>. Settings set thorugh <code>VBoxManage setextradata</code> are not officially supported and might be gone at some time such as now.
** VirtualBox documentation chapter [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html#hdimagewrites Special Image Write Modes] mentions <code>immutable images</code> but this might not be as good as <code>read-only images</code>.
** An additional issue, see also: https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/livecheck-sh-script-broken-on-bookworm/269/2

'''2.''' Set the VM disks to read-only.

Follow these steps:

* Power off the virtual machine (VM).
* Set the disk to read-only.
** The name of the VM in the following example below is <code>{{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce</code>. It could be replaced with the name of any other VM such as <code>{{project_name_gateway_short}}-Xfce</code>.
** On the host command line, run.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly" 1
}}

'''3.''' Remove VirtualBox virtual DVD drive.

This is only required if the VM has a virtual DVD drive. It is not required in {{project_name_long}} version <code>15.0.1.2.7</code> and above since it no longer comes with a virtual DVD drive by default. See footnote for a {{project_name_long}} build version lower than <code>15.0.1.2.7</code>. <ref>
{{VirtualBox_DVD_Remove}}

https://forums.whonix.org/t/no-longer-add-virtual-dvd-drive-to-vm-by-default/9337
</ref>

'''4.''' Launch the live system.

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "VM Live Mode-mode" will be visible. Select it and then press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

'''5.''' ''Optional:'' Revert the read-only change.

To boot into normal mode again, run this command on the host to revert the change.

{{CodeSelect|code=
VBoxManage setextradata {{project_name_workstation_short}}-Xfce "VBoxInternal/Devices/lsilogicsas/0/LUN#0/AttachedDriver/Config/ReadOnly"
}}

The normal boot option can now be selected in the GRUB menu.

'''6.''' ''Optional:'' Re-add the virtual DVD.

Only when you need this; see footnotes. <ref>
{{VirtualBox_DVD_Add}}

}}

Troubleshooting: If the system does not boot, check the [[VirtualBox/Recommended_Version|Recommended VirtualBox Version]] for {{project_name_long}} VirtualBox is in use.

== KVM ==
{{Box|text=
'''1.''' Set the VM disks to read-only.

Follow these steps:
* Power off the machine.
* Set the hard disk to read-only in the virt-manager GUI before booting into live mode.

'''2.''' Launch live-mode.

Following reboot, a second boot entry called "VM Live Mode-mode" will be visible. Select it and then press <code>Enter</code> to boot the live system and use it as normal.

'''3.''' ''Optional:'' Revert the read-only change.

To boot into normal mode again, revert the change from step 1 and choose the normal boot option in the GRUB menu.
