= pre tag test =

The following two lines <code>test1</code> and <code>test2</code> are separate pre tags lines. These should be visually separate. Currently functional.

<pre>
test1
</pre>

<pre>
test2
</pre>

= Blockquote Test =
For wiki content writers it is customary to write keywords such as <nowiki><blockquote></nowiki> into a separate line for easier readability during editing. But if that has to be avoided and changed in the wiki content (wiki markup), then that would be OK too.

<pre>
<blockquote>line number one
line number two
line number three
now there will be an empty line

    this line has leading whitespace
last but one line
last line</blockquote>
</pre>

Test result, too much white space:

<blockquote>line number one
line number two
line number three
now there will be an empty line

    this line has leading whitespace
last but one line
last line</blockquote>

== Complex Blockquote Example ==
This is how it really looks:

<blockquote>

Potential bug: Between line <code>Primary key fingerprint: 2133 BC60 0AB1 33E1 D826  D173 FE43 009C 4607 B1FB</code> and line <code>Subkey fingerprint: 7A02 B352 1DC7 5C54 2BA0  1545 6AFE E6D4 9E92 B601</code> there is no newline in the wiki markup and there should be none in the resulting mediawiki auto generated HTML. Some CSS issue probably?
