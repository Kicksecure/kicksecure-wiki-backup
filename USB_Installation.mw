{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. It comes in two flavors: a non-persistent Live USB system, and a persistent USB booted operating system.
}}

= Introduction =

'''{{project_name_short}} can be easily and comfortably booted and used from a USB data stick'''. No need to install it on your hard drive. Once {{project_name_short}} has been flashed on a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and you're ready to work with {{project_name_short}}, managing tasks requiring robust security. '''There are two options available.'''

These options are available for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

'''Note:'''

* '''ISO LIVE mode''': This is a non-persistent mode where changes are never saved. Every time you boot, it starts fresh, and any data or changes made during the session are lost when you shut down.
* '''PERSISTENT mode''': Saves and retains user data created during a session of {{project_name_short}}, ensuring that all changes and files, updates, software installations remain available in future sessions. [[Persistent Mode]] functions like a standard operating system installation, where any modifications made will persist across reboots.
* '''OPT-IN LIVE mode''': Even though the system is installed in '''persistent mode''' (meaning changes would normally be saved), this option allows you to '''temporarily boot in a non-persistent mode''' ([[Live Mode]]) where changes are not saved for that session. After restarting, you can choose to boot back into the normal persistent mode, where changes are saved again.

{{IconSet|h2|6}} Remove the USB stick that contains the {{project_name_short}} installer ISO ("LIVE-USB").

{{IconSet|h2|7}} Keep the USB with the installed {{project_name_short}} ("PERSISTENT-USB") connected.

{{IconSet|h2|8}} Boot from the installed {{project_name_short}} USB stick ("PERSISTENT-USB").

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? - Such an image has not been developed yet due to complex [[Dev/image_formats|technical challenges]]. Note that due to these complex challenges, almost no other Linux distributions offer such functionality either. To circumvent this, a "detour" through flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required to run the {{project_name_short}} installer.

Advanced users could also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Morph the Debian installation into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

This mode boots a {{project_name_short}} USB installed in Live Mode. This option can be practical in certain situations.

{{IconSet|h2|1}} Follow all the steps listed in [[#PERSISTENT_Mode]].

{{IconSet|h2|2}} During the booting process in the GRUB boot menu, choose "Live Mode USER".

{{IconSet|h2|3}} Done.

Info:

Live mode is facilitated by the pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[grub-live]] allows the host operating system - in this case, {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick - to boot into live mode. See [[Live Mode]] for further information.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

{{mbox
|text=
{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-check cs-green}} '''Simple to Try-Out''': An easy way to try out {{project_name_short}} without needing to install {{project_name_short}} on your computer.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-thumbs-up cs-green}} '''Way easier than Dual Boot''': It is much easier to install an operating system on a separate USB drive than attempting to set up dual boot on the same hard drive.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-shield-halved cs-blue}} '''Better Security''': A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> In the case of using Dual Boot, using physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-key cs-blue}} '''Can be unplugged and securely stored''': When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
