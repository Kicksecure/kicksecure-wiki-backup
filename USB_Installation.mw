{{project_name_short}} can be installed as a host {{os}} on a physical machine, as a guest OS on a virtual machine or as a contained portable host OS on a USB data stick.

This USB option is designed for:

* '''A)''' Users who want to boot into '''persistent mode''' (no saved data is lost after reboot), <u>and/or</u>
* '''B)''' Users who want to boot into non-persistent '''live mode''' which does not save changes after reboot.

Once installed on a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and manage tasks requiring robust security.

= Installation / Use =
Two options for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

* '''A)''' Non-persistent ISO Live Mode USB installation, also referred to as ISO Live Mode;
* '''B)''' Persistent USB installation, also known as USB installed {{project_name_short}}.

Persistence in this context means that users' data created during a session of {{project_name_short}} will be persistent. For example, documents created and bookmarks added will still be available after a reboot in persistent mode.

* '''A)''' To set up ISO Live Mode, simply [[ISO|download the ISO]] and flash it to a USB according to the instructions. Boot. Done.
* '''B)''' To set up USB installed {{project_name_short}}, download the ISO, flash it to a USB, boot, click "install to hard drive," and select a different USB device as the installation target.

Mixed mode / selection mode.

Live mode is facilitated by the ISO or pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[Grub-live]] allows the host operating system - in this case, {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick - to boot into [[Live Mode]].

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due to technical challenges. <ref>
* grml-debootstrap, the tool used to create {{project_name_short}} based images, does not support creating encrypted images. upstream feature request: [https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap/issues/131 encrypted VM images support]
* Porting to mkosi might be an option because it supports encryption, but that has not been done yet.
</ref> Therefore, a "detour" through flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required to run the {{project_name_short}} installer. Note that very few Linux distributions offer such functionality.

There is also a different option for advanced users. See footnote. <ref>
Advanced users could also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Distribution-morph Debian into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

* A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name_short}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref>
* Reason 1: Using physical external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.
* Reason 2: When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
