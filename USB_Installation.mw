{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. It comes in two flavors: a non-persistent Live USB system, and a persistent operating system booted from USB.
}}

= Introduction =

'''{{project_name_short}} can be easily and comfortably booted and used from a USB data stick'''. No need to install it on your hard drive. Once {{project_name_short}} has been flashed to a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and you're ready to work with {{project_name_short}}, managing tasks that require robust security. '''There are two options available.'''

= Installation / Use =

These options are available for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

* The user will need <u>two different</u> USB devices. The following names are arbitrary and just for your understanding.
** {{IconSet|true|A}} '''LIVE-USB''': A USB drive to install the LIVE Mode on.

* The Kicksecure Persistent USB configuration varies depending on whether you boot the Kicksecure Live USB with BIOS or UEFI.

*  If you boot the Live USB with BIOS and create a Persistent USB,
** 1. There will be two partitions: 'boot' and 'rootfs'.
** 2. There will be a Bootloader Location option. Simply select the USB and proceed.

* If you boot the Live USB with UEFI and create a Persistent USB,
** 1. There will be three partitions: 'efi', 'boot', and 'rootfs'.
** 2. There will be no Bootloader Location option.

* Assuming that Computer A supports only BIOS and Computer B supports only UEFI,
** 1. The Live USB can boot on both Computer A and Computer B.
** 2. If you create a Persistent USB on Computer A, the USB will boot on Computer A but not on Computer B.
** 3. If you create a Persistent USB using Computer B, the USB will be bootable on Computer B, but not on Computer A.

* Most computers support both BIOS and UEFI, so you can enable both in the BIOS/UEFI settings.

{{IconSet|h2|3}} On the [[ISO]] page, read the [[ISO#Download.2C_Create_Live_USB|Download, Create Live USB]] section.

{{IconSet|h2|4}} Follow the instructions to flash it to a USB stick ("LIVE-USB").

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due to complex [[Dev/image_formats|technical challenges]]. Note that because of these complex challenges, almost no other Linux distributions offer such functionality either. To work around this, a "detour" via first flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required before running the {{project_name_short}} installer.

Advanced users can also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on the USB stick. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Morph the Debian installation into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

Info:

Live mode is facilitated by the pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[grub-live]] allows the host operating system, in this case {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick, to boot into live mode. See [[Live Mode]] for further information.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

{{mbox
|text=
{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-check cs-green}} '''Simple to Try Out''': An easy way to try out {{project_name_short}} without needing to install {{project_name_short}} on your computer.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-thumbs-up cs-green}} '''Way easier than Dual Boot''': It is much easier to install an operating system on a separate USB drive than attempting to set up a dual boot on the same hard drive.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-shield-halved cs-blue}} '''Better Security''': A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on a dedicated ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]) external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> When using Dual Boot, physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-key cs-blue}} '''Can be unplugged and securely stored''': When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
