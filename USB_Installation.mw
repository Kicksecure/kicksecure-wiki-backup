{{project_name_short}} can be installed as a host {{os}} on a physical machine, as a guest OS on a virtual machine or as a contained portable host OS on a USB data stick.

This USB option is interesting for:

* '''A)''' Users who want to boot into '''persistent mode''' (no saved data is lost after reboot), <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Users who want to boot into non-persistent '''live mode''' which is pre-installed by default via the <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[Grub-live]] makes it possible to boot the host operating system - in this case {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick - into [[Live Mode]].

Once installed on a USB data stick simply plugin the stick, boot {{project_name_short}} and handle all your tasks which need a very solid security.

= Installation / Use =
Two options for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

* A) non-persistent ISO Live Mode USB installation, also called ISO live mode;
* B) persistent USB installation, also called  USB installed Kicksecure.

Persistence in this context means that users data created during a session of {{project_name_short}} will be persistent. For example documents created, bookmarks added would still be avaialble after reboot in persistent mode.

* A) To setup ISO Live mode, simply download the ISO and flash it to USB according to the instructions. Boot. Done.
* B) To setup USB installed Kicksecure, simply download the ISO and flash it to USB, boot, click "install to hard drive" and select a different USB device as installation target.

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due to technical challenges. <ref>

https://github.com/grml/grml-debootstrap/issues/131

Or port to mkosi which supports FDE.
</ref> Therefore a "detour" of flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required to be able to run the {{project_name_short}} installer. Note, that there are very few Linux distributions providing such functionality.

Advanced users could also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions can be found on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. But there are also a number of other online guides explaining how to install Debian on a USB.
# Distribution-morph Debian into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

* A higher level of security is attained by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name_short}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) like a USB flash drive or others. <ref>e. g. eSATA<br>FireWire should be best avoided
* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref>
* Reason 1: Using physical external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.
* Reason 2: When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
