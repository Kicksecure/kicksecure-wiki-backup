{{project_name_long}} can be installed as a host {{os}} on a physical machine, as a guest OS on a virtual machine or as a contained portable host OS on a USB data stick.

This USB option is interesting for:

* '''A)''' Users who want to boot into '''persistent mode''' (no saved data is lost after reboot), <u>or</u>
* '''B)''' Users who want to boot into non-persistent '''live mode''' which is pre-installed by default via the <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[Grub-live]] makes it possible to boot the host operating system - in this case {{project_name_long}} on a USB data stick - into [[Live Mode]].

Once installed on a USB data stick simply plugin the stick, boot {{project_name_long}} and handle all your tasks which need a very solid security.

= Installation / Use =

At this time the installation of {{project_name_long}} on a USB data stick needs a skilled user, because we do not provide a USB creator / image yet. Skilled users however can create a {{project_name_long}} USB stick following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions can be found on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. But there are also a number of other online guides explaining how to install Debian on a USB.
# Distribution-morph Debian into {{project_name_long}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_long}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

= Advantages of {{project_name_long}} on USB =

* A higher level of security is attained by installing the host operating system(s) required for {{project_name_long}} on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) like a USB flash drive or others. <ref>e. g. eSATA<br>FireWire should be best avoided
* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref>
* Reason 1: Using physical external media reduces the risk of other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_long}} host operating system.
* Reason 2: When {{project_name_long}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
