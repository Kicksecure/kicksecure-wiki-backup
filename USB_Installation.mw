{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. It comes in two flavors: a non-persistent Live USB system, and a persistent operating system booted from USB.
}}

= Introduction =

'''{{project_name_short}} can be easily and comfortably booted and used from a USB data stick'''. No need to install it on your hard drive. Once {{project_name_short}} has been flashed to a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and you are ready to work with {{project_name_short}} for tasks that require robust security. '''There are two options available.'''

= Installation / Use =

The following options are available for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

|item=fa-solid fa-compact-disc cs-blue,<b>ISO LIVE mode:</b> A <u>non-persistent</u> mode where changes are never saved. Every time you boot, the system starts fresh, and any data or changes made during the session are lost when you shut down.

|item=fa-solid fa-retweet cs-orange,<b>OPT-IN LIVE mode:</b> Even though the system is installed in <b>persistent mode</b> (meaning changes would normally be saved), this option allows you to <b>temporarily boot into a non-persistent mode</b> (<a href="/wiki/Live_Mode">Live Mode</a>) where changes are not saved for that session. After restarting, you can choose to boot back into the normal persistent mode, where changes are saved again.

* <u>Why this matters:</u> The persistent USB setup depends on how you started (booted) the Live USB. Computers can start in two common ways: <code>BIOS</code> (older) or <code>UEFI</code> (newer).
* <u>If you booted the Live USB with BIOS:</u> You will usually see two partitions on the new USB (<code>boot</code> and <code>rootfs</code>), and the installer will show a "Bootloader Location" step. Select the target USB device and continue.
* <u>If you booted the Live USB with UEFI:</u> You will usually see three partitions (<code>efi</code>, <code>boot</code>, and <code>rootfs</code>), and the installer will not show a "Bootloader Location" step.
* <u>Compatibility between different computers:</u> The same Live USB can often boot on different computers, but a persistent USB created while booted in BIOS mode may only boot on computers using BIOS, and a persistent USB created while booted in UEFI mode may only boot on computers using UEFI. This is a known issue and might get fixed in a future version.
* <u>Practical tip:</u> Many computers support both <code>BIOS</code> and <code>UEFI</code>. Check the BIOS or UEFI settings and enable the boot mode you plan to use.

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due to complex [[Dev/image_formats|technical challenges]]. Because of these challenges, almost no other Linux distributions offer this functionality either. To work around this, a "detour" via first flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required before running the {{project_name_short}} installer.

Advanced users can also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on the USB stick. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Morph the Debian installation into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

Info:

Live Mode is facilitated by the pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[grub-live]] allows the host operating system, in this case {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick, to boot into Live Mode. See [[Live Mode]] for further information.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

{{mbox
|text=
{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-check cs-green}} '''Simple to Try Out''': An easy way to try out {{project_name_short}} without needing to install {{project_name_short}} on your computer.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-thumbs-up cs-green}} '''Way easier than Dual Boot''': It is much easier to install an operating system on a separate USB drive than attempting to set up a dual boot on the same hard drive.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-shield-halved cs-blue}} '''Better Security''': A higher level of security can be achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on dedicated ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]) external disk(s), such as a USB flash drive or similar media. <ref>
For example, eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided for security reasons:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> Compared to dual booting, physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.

{{Icon|style=circle|fa-solid fa-key cs-blue}} '''Can be unplugged and securely stored''': When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
