{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. This is particularly interesting for users looking for a portable '''persistent''' <u>or</u> '''live''' operating system.
}}
= Introduction =
This USB option is designed for:

* '''A)''' Users who want to boot into non-persistent '''live mode''' which does not save user created data after reboot, <u>and/or</u>
* '''B)''' Users who want to boot into '''persistent mode''' (saved data is still available after reboot).

Once installed on a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and manage tasks requiring robust security.

= Installation / Use =
Two options for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

* '''A)''' Non-persistent ISO Live Mode USB installation, also referred to as ISO Live Mode;
* '''B)''' Persistent USB installation, also known as USB installed {{project_name_short}}.

Persistence in this context means that users' data created during a session of {{project_name_short}} will be persistent. For example, documents created and bookmarks added will still be available after a reboot in persistent mode.

Choose an option below.

To set up USB installed {{project_name_short}} (persistent mode), 

'''1.''' [[ISO|Download the ISO]].

'''2.''' Flash it to a USB according to the instructions.

'''3.''' Boot.

'''4.''' Click "install to hard drive," and select a different USB device as the installation target.

'''5.''' Power off.

Shutdown the live session.

'''6.''' Remove the USB stick that contains the {{project_name_short}} installer ISO.

'''7.''' Keep the USB installed {{project_name_short}} connected.

'''8.''' Boot the {{project_name_short}} USB.

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due to [[Dev/image_formats|technical challenges]]. Therefore, a "detour" through flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required to run the {{project_name_short}} installer. Note that very few Linux distributions offer such functionality.

There is also a different option for advanced users. See footnote. <ref>
Advanced users could also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Distribution-morph Debian into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.
</ref>

{{Tab|
|active=
|title= == Opt-in Live Mode ==
|image=
|content=
[[File:Live-mode-promo.jpg|thumb|Live Mode boot option selectable in boot menu.]]
This could be considered "selection mode", "opt-in mode" or "mixed mode".

Follow the same steps as for USB installed Kicksecure.

Live mode is facilitated by pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[grub-live]] allows the host operating system - in this case, {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick - to boot into live mode. This can be done by selecting live mode in the GRUB boot menu. See [[Live Mode]].

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

* <u>Easy Try-Out:</u> An easy way to try out {{project_name_short}} without needing to install {{project_name_short}} on your computer.
* <u>Simple Dual Boot:</u> It is much easier to install an operating system a separate USB drive than attempting to set up dual boot on the same hard drive.
* <u>Better Security:</u> A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> In case of using Dual Boot using physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.
* <u>Unplugging:</u> When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
