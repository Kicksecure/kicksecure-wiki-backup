{{intro|
'''{{project_name_short}} can be used as a plug-and-play operating system on a USB data stick'''. It comes in 2 flavors: a non-persistent Live USB system, but also as a persistent USB booted operating system.
}}

= Introduction =

'''{{project_name_short}} can be easily and comfortably booted and used from a USB data stick'''. No need to install it to your harddrive. Once installed on a USB data stick, simply plug in the stick, boot {{project_name_short}}, and you're ready to work with {{project_name_short}} managing tasks requiring robust security. '''There are 2 options available.'''

These options are available for {{project_name_short}} on USB.

'''NOTE'''
* '''ISO LIVE mode''' looses all user created data on shutdown
* '''PERSISTENT mode''' saves and retains users' data created during a session of {{project_name_short}} for future use.
* '''OPT-IN LIVE mode''' uses a persistent installation and starts it in Live mode.

We differentiate "LIVE modes" between "<u>ISO LIVE mode</u>" and <u>OPT-IN LIVE mode</u>, because the ISO LIVE mode is booted from a read-only device created adhering to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660 ISO_9660] specifications (hence "ISO"). In contrast the  OPT-IN LIVE mode uses the GRUB boot menu to boot into live mode.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-2 cs-green}} Follow the instructions to flash it to a USB stick ("LIVE-USB")

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-3 cs-green}} Boot.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-4 cs-green}} On the desktop click "install to hard drive," and select the second USB device ("PERSISTENT-USB") as the installation target.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-5 cs-green}} Power off. (Shutdown the live session.)

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-6 cs-green}} Remove the USB stick that contains the {{project_name_short}} installer ISO ("LIVE-USB").

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-7 cs-green}} Keep the USB with the installed {{project_name_short}} ("PERSISTENT-USB") connected.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-8 cs-green}} Boot from the installed {{project_name_short}} USB stick ("PERSISTENT-USB").

Why not just flash a persistent {{project_name_short}} image to USB? Such an image has not been developed yet due '''to [[Dev/image_formats|technical challenges]]. Therefore, a "detour" through flashing a {{project_name_short}} ISO is required to run the {{project_name_short}} installer. Note that very few Linux distributions offer such functionality'''.

Advanced users could also create a {{project_name_short}} USB stick by following these instructions:

# Take a USB data stick with at least 16 GB of space.
# Install Debian on USB. Instructions are available on the [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive Debian Wiki]. Additional online guides explain how to install Debian on a USB.
# Distribution-morph Debian into {{project_name_short}}. Instructions for this can be found in our [[Debian|{{project_name_short}} for Debian installation guide]].
# Done.

This mode is basically booting a {{project_name_short}} USB installed in persistent mode but booted in Live Mode, which is an option we offer and which can be practical at times.

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-1 cs-green}} Follow all the steps listed in [[#PERSISTENT_Mode]]

{{Icon|fa-solid fa-2 cs-green}} In the booting process in the GRUB boot menu choose "Live Mode USER"

Live mode is facilitated by pre-installed <code>grub-live</code> software package. [[grub-live]] allows the host operating system - in this case, {{project_name_short}} on a USB data stick - to boot into live mode. See [[Live Mode]] for further information.

= Advantages of {{project_name_short}} on USB =

{{mbox
|text=
{{Icon|style=round|fa-solid fa-check cs-green}} '''Simple to Try-Out''': An easy way to try out {{project_name_short}} without needing to install {{project_name_short}} on your computer.

{{Icon|style=round|fa-solid fa-thumbs-up cs-green}} '''Way easier than Dual Boot''': It is much easier to install an operating system a separate USB drive than attempting to set up dual boot on the same hard drive.

{{Icon|style=round|fa-solid fa-shield-halved cs-blue}} '''Better Security''': A higher level of security is achieved by installing the host operating system(s) on a dedicated, ([[Full Disk Encryption|encrypted]]), external disk(s) such as a USB flash drive or others. <ref>
e.g., eSATA or FireWire.

FireWire should generally be avoided:

* https://louwrentius.com/firewire-the-forgotten-security-risk.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394#Security_issues
</ref> In case of using Dual Boot using physical external media reduces the risk of malware running on other operating system(s) infecting the {{project_name_short}} host operating system.

{{Icon|style=round|fa-solid fa-key cs-blue}} '''Can be unplugged and securely stored''': When {{project_name_short}} disk(s) are not in use, they can either be removed or hidden.
