Information about system timezone setting. How to change the System Timezone. 
}}
= Installation Method Specific =
* If {{project_name_short}} is installed using ISO: Timezone can be configured during the ISO installer.
* If {{project_name_short}} is installed using [[Distribution Morphing]]: Timezone is unchanged by {{project_name_short}}. Same as set by user or installer.

= Unspecific to {{project_name_short}} =
Since [[About#Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_short}} is based on Debian]], changing the timezone will not differ from Debian. Therefore the user can also refer to any Debian specific documentation such as their [https://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges TimeZoneChanges] documentation.

= System Timezone Setting versus User Timezone Setting =

<u>Note:</u>

* '''A)''' System setting: System timezone as configured <code>/etc/timezone</code> / <code>/etc/localtime</code> is a "system setting". 
* '''B)''' User setting: What (Xfce) graphical user interface clock widget is showing and its setting might be independent from the "system setting" since that is a "user setting".

= Change System Timezone =

For example, to change the timezone to UTC:

'''1.''' Open a terminal.

'''2.''' Run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
}}

'''3.''' Then select "None of the above".

'''4.''' Press <code>Enter⏎</code> on "OK".

'''5.''' Then select <code>UTC</code>.

'''6.''' Select "OK" and press <code>Enter⏎</code>.

'''7.''' Done.

The timezone should have changed now. 

'''8.''' Timezone setting verification.

To check, run the following command.

{{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo timedatectl
}}

'''9.''' Review the output of <code>timedatectl</code>.

Should show something like this:
