Information about the system timezone setting and instructions on how to change it.
}}

= Installation Method Specific =
* '''A)''' <u>If {{project_name_short}} is installed using ISO:</u> the timezone can be configured during the ISO installation process.
* '''B)''' <u>If {{project_name_short}} is installed using [[Distribution Morphing]]:</u> the timezone remains unchanged by {{project_name_short}}. It remains as originally set by the user or installer.

= Unspecific to {{project_name_short}} =
Since [[Based_on_Debian|{{project_name_short}} is based on Debian]], changing the timezone does not differ from Debian. Therefore, users may also refer to Debian-specific documentation such as their [https://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges TimeZoneChanges] documentation.

= System Timezone Setting versus User Timezone Setting =

<u>Note:</u>

* '''A)''' <u>System setting:</u> The timezone configured via <code>/etc/timezone</code> or <code>/etc/localtime</code> is considered a "system setting".
* '''B)''' <u>User setting:</u> The timezone displayed by graphical interface widgets, such as the Xfce clock, is a "user setting" and might be independent of the system setting.

= Change System Timezone =

For example, to change the timezone to UTC:

'''1.''' Open a terminal.

'''2.''' Run the following command:

{{CodeSelect|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
}}

The timezone should now be changed.

'''8.''' Verify timezone setting.

To confirm, run the following command:

{{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo timedatectl
}}

'''9.''' Review the output of <code>timedatectl</code>.

It should appear similar to the following:
