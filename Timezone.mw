{{intro|
If {{project_name_long}} is installing using [[Distribution Morphing]]: timezone is unchanged. Same as set by user or installer.

Since Kicksecure is based on Debian, changing the timezone will not differ from Debian. For more information, you can refer to  Debian's [https://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges TimeZoneChanges] documentation.

To change the timezone to UTC, for example:

* Run {{CodeSelect|inline=true|code=
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
}} using your terminal. Then select "None of the above" then hit <code>Enter⏎</code> on "OK".

* Then Select "UTC" and hit <code>Enter⏎</code> on "OK".

sudo timedatectl
}} should show something like this:
