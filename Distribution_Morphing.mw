= Introduction =
The ability to convert an installed base distribution into a derivative distribution.

= Howto/Examples =
This can be achieved through installing packages from the package manager (sometimes with minor tweaks) and by that changing the mainstream distro into the forked/branched distro e.g:

* [[Debian|Debian to {{project_name_long}}]]
* [https://wiki.parabola.nu/Migration_from_Arch Arch to Parabola]
* [https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:migration:from_arch Arch to Hyperbola]

This can be expanded and can change fork to another fork using the same method (both forked/based on the same main stream distro) e.g:

* [https://wiki.parabola.nu/Migration_from_Manjaro Manjaro to Parabola]
* [https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:migration:from_parabola Parabola to Hyperbola]
